for systems and applications. The definition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in [](#\/cprt\/framework\/version\/SP_800_171_3_0_0\/home?element=03.01.02)03.01.02. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin. When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements). Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles may vary. Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by [](#\/cprt\/framework\/version\/SP_800_171_3_0_0\/home?element=03.01.10)

Flow control restrictions include keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking external communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies how the information flow is enforced (see [](#\/cprt\/framework\/version\/SP_800_171_3_0_0\/home?element=03.12.05)03.12.05). Transferring CUI between systems that represent different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).

designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities, and\/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Some organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices. The protection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting operating system and possibly other software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. On mobile devices, secure containers provide software-based data isolation designed to segment enterprise applications and information from personal apps and data. Containers may present multiple user interfaces, one of the most common being a mobile application that acts as a portal to a suite of business productivity apps, such as email, contacts, and calendar. Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile

security literacy training to system users (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and respond to incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling of CUI. Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting awareness events using podcasts, videos, and webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy training content on a regular basis ensures that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training content include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threats include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; sexual harassment or bullying of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, rules, directives, or practices of organizations. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to roles (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, threadjacking, social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Security literacy training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat and potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established policies and procedures."},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.02.01.a.01.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"security literacy training is provided to system users as part of initial training for new

Event types can include password changes, the execution of privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access — both successful and unsuccessful — but only activate that capability under specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.

Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection systems (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, system connections, and services.

Organizations can use technical and non-technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to devices. Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device — prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices — and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g., insertion of malicious code)."},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.08.07.a","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"the use of the following types of system media is restricted or prohibited: {{ insert: param, A.03.08.07.ODP.01 }}.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.08.07.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.08.07.b","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"the use of removable system media without an identifiable owner is prohibited.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.08.07.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"E-03.08.07_assessment-method_examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"system media protection policy and procedures\n\nsystem use policy\n\nprocedures for media usage restrictions\n\nrules of behavior\n\nsystem audit records\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"I-03.08.07_assessment-method_interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"personnel with system media use responsibilities\n\npersonnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem administrators"}]},{"id":"T-03.08.07_assessment-method_test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"processes for media use\n\nmechanisms for restricting or prohibiting the use of system media on systems or system components"}]}]},{"id":"SP_800_171_03.08.08","class":"requirement","title":"03.08.08","props":[{"name":"sort-id","value":"03.08.08"},{"name":"status","value":"withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"03.08.07","rel":"incorporated_into"}]},{"id":"SP_800_171_03.08.09","class":"requirement","title":"System Backup – Cryptographic Protection","props":[{"name":"sort-id","value":"03.08.09"},{"name":"label","value":"System Backup – Cryptographic Protection (03.08.09)"}],"links":[{"href":"#29cd3753-76bb-4b97-a484-f10c10d093ed","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#d820b996-2a6e-4c4d-9aa8-88118b0664b1","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#fefb62cb-b252-4071-a540-fa193db38895","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#cd930fe4-ad2c-4d44-954e-2755be2c8673","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#e7712341-d9f9-4f8b-9f32-516ddd1960e0","rel":"reference"}],"parts":[{"id":"statement_03.08.09","name":"statement","class":"security_requirement","parts":[{"id":"SR-03.08.09.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.08.09.a"}],"prose":"Protect the confidentiality of backup information."},{"id":"SR-03.08.09.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.08.09.b"}],"prose":"Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI at backup storage locations."}]},{"id":"guidance_D-03.08.09","name":"guidance","prose":"The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality of backup information.

The types of agreements can include information exchange security agreements, interconnection security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system developers, and system integrators). The types of information contained in exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and responsibilities for each system."},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.a.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"the exchange of CUI between the system and other systems is approved using {{ insert: param, A.03.12.05.ODP.01 }}.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.a.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"the exchange of CUI between the system and other systems is managed using {{ insert: param, A.03.12.05.ODP.01 }}.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.b.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"interface characteristics for each system are documented as part of the exchange agreements.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.b.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"security requirements for each system are documented as part of the exchange agreements.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.b.03","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"responsibilities for each system are documented as part of the exchange agreements.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.c.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"exchange agreements are reviewed {{ insert: param, A.03.12.05.ODP.02 }} .","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.c","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.12.05.c.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"exchange agreements are updated {{ insert: param, A.03.12.05.ODP.02 }} .","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.12.05.c","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"E-03.12.05_assessment-method_examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"access control policy and procedures\n\nprocedures for system connections\n\nsystem and communications protection policy and procedures\n\nsystem interconnection security agreements\n\ninformation exchange security agreements\n\nservice-level agreements\n\nmemoranda of understanding or agreements\n\nnon-disclosure agreements\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nenterprise architecture\n\nsecurity architecture\n\nsystem configuration settings\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"I-03.12.05_assessment-method_interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"personnel with development, implementation, and approval responsibilities for system interconnection agreements\n\npersonnel who manage systems to which the exchange agreements apply\n\npersonnel with information security responsibilities"}]}]}]},{"id":"SP_800_171_03.13","class":"family","title":"System and Communications Protection","props":[{"name":"sort-id","value":"03.13"},{"name":"label","value":"System and Communications Protection (03.13)"}],"controls":[{"id":"SP_800_171_03.13.01","class":"requirement","title":"Boundary Protection","props":[{"name":"sort-id","value":"03.13.01"},{"name":"label","value":"Boundary Protection (03.13.01)"}],"links":[{"href":"#a0545240-de4e-416d-8764-11c4ae62468a","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#2cf4ace8-d71c-4e8f-a472-f2502de8a550","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#a10063e9-0afe-4e96-9bb0-f308c8179077","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#905fc293-cebb-4cc6-90d6-c95ed047090b","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#2e702ac1-d107-4251-b12e-6816b9f20747","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#0bb2b4eb-d888-4ef1-b612-5ad3ac27a41a","rel":"reference"}],"parts":[{"id":"statement_03.13.01","name":"statement","class":"security_requirement","parts":[{"id":"SR-03.13.01.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.13.01.a"}],"prose":"Monitor and control communications at external managed interfaces to the system and key internal managed interfaces within the system."},{"id":"SR-03.13.01.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.13.01.b"}],"prose":"Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks."},{"id":"SR-03.13.01.c","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.13.01.c"}],"prose":"Connect to external systems only through managed interfaces that consist of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture."}]},{"id":"guidance_D-03.13.01","name":"guidance","prose":"Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, network-based malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, and encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture.

Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Non-signature-based mechanisms include reputation-based technologies. Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and software integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code execution. If malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in response to the detection of malicious code during scans, malicious downloads, or malicious activity when attempting to open or execute files."},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.a.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are implemented at system entry and exit points to detect malicious code.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.a.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are implemented at system entry and exit points to eradicate malicious code.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.a","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.b","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are updated as new releases are available in accordance with configuration management policy and procedures.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.b","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.c.01.01","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to perform scans of the system {{ insert: param, A.03.14.02.ODP.01 }}.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.c.01","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.c.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to block malicious code, quarantine malicious code, or take other actions in response to malicious code detection.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.c.02","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"assessment-objective_DS-A.03.14.02.c.01.02","name":"assessment-objective","prose":"malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to perform real-time scans of files from external sources at endpoints or system entry and exit points as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed.","links":[{"href":"#SR-03.14.02.c.01","rel":"assessment-for"}]},{"id":"E-03.14.02_assessment-method_examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"system and information integrity policy and procedures\n\nconfiguration management policy and procedures\n\nprocedures for malicious code protection\n\nrecords of malicious code protection updates\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings\n\nscan results from malicious code protection mechanisms\n\nrecord of actions initiated by malicious code protection mechanisms in response to malicious code detection\n\nsystem audit records\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"I-03.14.02_assessment-method_interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"personnel responsible for malicious code protection\n\npersonnel with system installation, configuration, or maintenance responsibilities\n\npersonnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem administrators"}]},{"id":"T-03.14.02_assessment-method_test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"processes for employing, updating, and configuring malicious code protection mechanisms\n\nprocesses for addressing the detection of false positives and resulting potential impacts\n\nmechanisms for supporting or implementing, employing, updating, and configuring malicious code protection mechanisms\n\nmechanisms for supporting or implementing malicious code scanning and the execution of subsequent actions"}]}]},{"id":"SP_800_171_03.14.03","class":"requirement","title":"Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives","props":[{"name":"sort-id","value":"03.14.03"},{"name":"label","value":"Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives (03.14.03)"}],"links":[{"href":"#e522acff-a07b-48a7-ad5c-e4a7faa1b84f","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#a249da1e-0a36-4942-ae4e-e84bb7b78b51","rel":"reference"}],"parts":[{"id":"statement_03.14.03","name":"statement","class":"security_requirement","parts":[{"id":"SR-03.14.03.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.14.03.a"}],"prose":"Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from external organizations on an ongoing basis."},{"id":"SR-03.14.03.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-03.14.03.b"}],"prose":"Generate and disseminate internal system security alerts, advisories, and directives, as necessary."}]},{"id":"guidance_D-03.14.03","name":"guidance","prose":"There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories.

Internal monitoring includes the observation of events that occur within the system. External monitoring includes the observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Organizations can monitor the system by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives. Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling to external systems.

Threat actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain, theft, and the insertion of malicious software, firmware, and hardware. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The system-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy implementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM requirements and the development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support mission and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational
