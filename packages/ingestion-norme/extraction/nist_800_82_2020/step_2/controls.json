An organization may consider a system to be external if that system performs different functions, implements different policies, falls under different management authorities, or does not provide sufficient visibility into the implementation of controls to allow the establishment of a satisfactory trust relationship. For example, an OT system and a business data processing system may be considered external to each other depending on the organization’s system boundaries. Access to an OT for support by a business partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of external systems is reexamined with respect to OT functions, purposes, technology, and limitations to establish a clearly documented technical or business case for use and an acceptance of the risk inherent in the use of an external system.",

In general, OT systems are highly sensitive to timing constraints and have limited resources. Example compensating controls include employing a replicated, virtualized, or simulated system to conduct penetration testing. Production OT may need to be taken offline before testing can be conducted. If OT systems are taken offline for testing, tests are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever possible. If penetration testing is performed on non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure that tests do not propagate into the OT network. Rationale for removing CA-8 (1) from HIGH baseline: Specific expertise is necessary to conduct effective penetration testing on OT systems, and it may not be feasible to identify independent personnel with the appropriate skillset or knowledge to perform penetration testing on an OT environment. While an independent penetration test agent or team is recommended, it may not be feasible for all high-impact OT systems.",

This may include active scanning, passive monitoring, or compensating controls, depending on the system being scanned. For example, vulnerability examination may be performed using passive monitoring and manual visual inspection to maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets. That inventory can be cross-referenced against a list of known vulnerabilities (e.g., CISA advisories, NIST NVD). Production may need to be taken offline before active scans can be conducted. Scans are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on adjacent non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure that they do not mistakenly scan the OT network. Automated network scanning is not applicable to non-routable communications, such as serial networks. Compensating controls include providing a replicated or simulated system for conducting scans or host-based vulnerability applications.",

Sometimes, the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk if no vendor patch is available, if patching requires additional time to complete validation or testing, or if deployment requires an unacceptable operations shutdown. In these situations, compensating controls should be implemented (e.g., limiting the exposure of the vulnerable system, restricting vulnerable services, implementing virtual patching). Other compensating controls that do not decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable (e.g., provide a timely response in case of an incident, devise a plan to ensure that the OT can identify exploitation of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an OT may exceed the organization’s available resources.",
