Machinery and related products that fall within the categories listed in Annex I, Part A, shall be subject to the specific conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 25(2), and machinery and related products that fall within the categories listed in Annex I, Part B shall be subject to the specific conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 25(3). 2. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to amend Annex I, after consulting the stakeholders concerned, in the light of technical progress, advances in knowledge or new scientific evidence by adding to the list of categories of machinery and related products in Annex I a new category of machinery or related products, withdrawing an existing category of machinery or related products from that list or moving a category of machinery or related products from one Part of Annex I to another Part of that Annex, in accordance with the criteria and the procedures laid down in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of this Article. 3. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall seek the views of experts in the relevant expert group in accordance with Article 47(4). 4. The Commission shall assess the seriousness of the inherent potential risk presented by a category of machinery or related product for the purpose of determining whether to add that category of machinery or related product to Annex I or to withdraw that category of machinery or related product from Annex I. That assessment shall be established based on the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. In determining the probability and severity of harm, the following criteria shall, where relevant, be taken into account: (a) the nature of the hazard inherent to the function of the category of machinery or related product, taking into account the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse; (b) the severity of harm which a person would suffer, including the degree of reversibility of that harm; (c) the number of persons potentially affected by the harm; (d) the frequency and the duration of the exposure to the hazard that a person would be exposed to in the course of the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of the category of machinery or related product; (e) the possibilities of avoiding or limiting harm; (f) in the case of safety components, the likelihood of serious consequences for the safety of the persons exposed to harm in the event of their failure. 5. When conducting the assessment referred in paragraph 4, the Commission shall consider the following elements: (a) indications of harm that have been caused in the past by machinery or related products which have been used for their intended use or following any reasonably foreseeable misuse; (b) information about safety defects detected in the course of market surveillance, and material possibly available in the information systems administered by the Commission; (c) information about known accidents and serious ‘close calls’, including the characteristics of those accidents or ‘close calls’; (d) data on accidents or damage to health caused by the machinery or related product for at least the preceding four years. In particular, information obtained, inter alia, from the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS), safeguard clauses, Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, the European Injury Database (EU-IDB), Eurostat’s European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) and the Machinery Administrative Cooperation Group (AdCo). In addition to points (a) to (d) of this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account any other information available that is relevant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4. 6. The data and information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d), shall be provided by Member States in accordance with paragraph 9. 7. A category of machinery or related product shall be included in Annex I, Part A, if, according to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4, and taking into account the available information, including the data referred to in paragraph 5, it presents a serious inherent potential risk, and one or more of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) there is a lack of harmonised standards or common specifications covering the relevant essential health and safety requirements; (b) residual risks exist, including those which, according to the manufacturer, could be reduced by particular training or personal protective equipment, and the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, demonstrate the recurrence of similar serious or fatal accidents or damage to health in connection with those residual risks; (c) data and information exist which according to the Commission demonstrate recurring wrongful application of the relevant harmonised standards or common specifications and for which the market surveillance activities that were carried out have not led to major improvements of the market situation, in a reasonable period; (d) there is a degree of uncertainty in the existing risk assessment methods related to new categories of machinery or technologies. Any other category of machinery or related product that, according to that assessment, presents a serious inherent potential risk but does not fulfil one or more of the conditions in points (a) to (d) shall be included in Annex I, Part B. 8. A Member State which has concerns about a category of machinery or related product being listed or not in Annex I shall immediately inform the Commission of those concerns and provide reasons in support thereof. The Commission shall conduct the assessment referred to in paragraph 4 immediately after being informed by a Member State. After making that assessment, the Commission may initiate the procedure laid down in paragraph 2. 9. By 14 July 2025, and every five years thereafter, Member States shall provide the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, including information to the effect that none of the events referred to in paragraph 5 has occurred, for every category of machinery or related products which is included in Annex I or which is not included in Annex I where that non-inclusion is a cause of concern for the Member State. 10. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out and, where necessary in the light of technological and market development, updating a template concerning the collection by Member States of the data and the information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d). When adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall issue guidance to Member States on the collection and transmission of comparable, high-quality data and information. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 48(3). The first such implementing act shall be adopted not later than 14 July 2024. 11. If necessary after the Commission report referred to in Article 53(3), the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to supplement paragraph 5 of this Article by specifying the obligations of Member States to provide data and information required pursuant to this Article through the establishment of a common methodology concerning the data and information to be collected, including the methods for their collection and compilation, and the procedures for their transmission, as well as the relevant definitions, in order to ensure that sufficient and comparable data is available for the Commission to carry out the assessment referred to in paragraph 4.Categories of machinery and related products listed in Annex I subject to relevant conformity assessment procedures",

Machinery and related products that fall within the categories listed in Annex I, Part A, shall be subject to the specific conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 25(2), and machinery and related products that fall within the categories listed in Annex I, Part B shall be subject to the specific conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 25(3). 2. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to amend Annex I, after consulting the stakeholders concerned, in the light of technical progress, advances in knowledge or new scientific evidence by adding to the list of categories of machinery and related products in Annex I a new category of machinery or related products, withdrawing an existing category of machinery or related products from that list or moving a category of machinery or related products from one Part of Annex I to another Part of that Annex, in accordance with the criteria and the procedures laid down in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of this Article. 3. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall seek the views of experts in the relevant expert group in accordance with Article 47(4). 4. The Commission shall assess the seriousness of the inherent potential risk presented by a category of machinery or related product for the purpose of determining whether to add that category of machinery or related product to Annex I or to withdraw that category of machinery or related product from Annex I. That assessment shall be established based on the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. In determining the probability and severity of harm, the following criteria shall, where relevant, be taken into account: (a) the nature of the hazard inherent to the function of the category of machinery or related product, taking into account the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse; (b) the severity of harm which a person would suffer, including the degree of reversibility of that harm; (c) the number of persons potentially affected by the harm; (d) the frequency and the duration of the exposure to the hazard that a person would be exposed to in the course of the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of the category of machinery or related product; (e) the possibilities of avoiding or limiting harm; (f) in the case of safety components, the likelihood of serious consequences for the safety of the persons exposed to harm in the event of their failure. 5. When conducting the assessment referred in paragraph 4, the Commission shall consider the following elements: (a) indications of harm that have been caused in the past by machinery or related products which have been used for their intended use or following any reasonably foreseeable misuse; (b) information about safety defects detected in the course of market surveillance, and material possibly available in the information systems administered by the Commission; (c) information about known accidents and serious ‘close calls’, including the characteristics of those accidents or ‘close calls’; (d) data on accidents or damage to health caused by the machinery or related product for at least the preceding four years. In particular, information obtained, inter alia, from the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS), safeguard clauses, Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, the European Injury Database (EU-IDB), Eurostat’s European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) and the Machinery Administrative Cooperation Group (AdCo). In addition to points (a) to (d) of this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account any other information available that is relevant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4. 6. The data and information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d), shall be provided by Member States in accordance with paragraph 9. 7. A category of machinery or related product shall be included in Annex I, Part A, if, according to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4, and taking into account the available information, including the data referred to in paragraph 5, it presents a serious inherent potential risk, and one or more of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) there is a lack of harmonised standards or common specifications covering the relevant essential health and safety requirements; (b) residual risks exist, including those which, according to the manufacturer, could be reduced by particular training or personal protective equipment, and the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, demonstrate the recurrence of similar serious or fatal accidents or damage to health in connection with those residual risks; (c) data and information exist which according to the Commission demonstrate recurring wrongful application of the relevant harmonised standards or common specifications and for which the market surveillance activities that were carried out have not led to major improvements of the market situation, in a reasonable period; (d) there is a degree of uncertainty in the existing risk assessment methods related to new categories of machinery or technologies. Any other category of machinery or related product that, according to that assessment, presents a serious inherent potential risk but does not fulfil one or more of the conditions in points (a) to (d) shall be included in Annex I, Part B. 8. A Member State which has concerns about a category of machinery or related product being listed or not in Annex I shall immediately inform the Commission of those concerns and provide reasons in support thereof. The Commission shall conduct the assessment referred to in paragraph 4 immediately after being informed by a Member State. After making that assessment, the Commission may initiate the procedure laid down in paragraph 2. 9. By 14 July 2025, and every five years thereafter, Member States shall provide the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, including information to the effect that none of the events referred to in paragraph 5 has occurred, for every category of machinery or related products which is included in Annex I or which is not included in Annex I where that non-inclusion is a cause of concern for the Member State. 10. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out and, where necessary in the light of technological and market development, updating a template concerning the collection by Member States of the data and the information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d). When adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall issue guidance to Member States on the collection and transmission of comparable, high-quality data and information. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 48(3). The first such implementing act shall be adopted not later than 14 July 2024. 11. If necessary after the Commission report referred to in Article 53(3), the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to supplement paragraph 5 of this Article by specifying the obligations of Member States to provide data and information required pursuant to this Article through the establishment of a common methodology concerning the data and information to be collected, including the methods for their collection and compilation, and the procedures for their transmission, as well as the relevant definitions, in order to ensure that sufficient and comparable data is available for the Commission to carry out the assessment referred to in paragraph 4.10. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out and, where necessary in the light of technological and market development, updating a template concerning the collection by Member States of the data and the information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d). When adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall issue guidance to Member States on the collection and transmission of comparable, high-quality data and information.

When placing machinery or a related product on the market or putting it into service, manufacturers shall ensure that it has been designed and constructed in accordance with the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 2. Before placing machinery or a related product on the market or putting it into service, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part A and carry out the relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 25 or have it carried out. Where compliance of machinery or a related product with the essential health and safety requirements laid down in Annex III has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 21 and affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 24. 3. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the machinery or the related product has been placed on the market or put into service. Where relevant, the source code or the programming logic included in the technical documentation shall, upon a reasoned request, be made available to the competent national authorities, if that source code or programming logic is necessary in order for them to be able to check compliance with the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 4. Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place in order that machinery or related products that are part of a series production remain in conformity with this Regulation. Adequate account shall be taken of changes in the production process or in the design or characteristics of the machinery or related product, and changes in the harmonised standards, in other technical specifications, or in the common specifications referred to in Article 20 by reference to which the conformity of the machinery or related product is declared. When deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by machinery or related products, manufacturers shall, in order to protect the health and safety of users, carry out sample testing of machinery or related products made available on the market and investigate their results. If necessary, manufacturers shall keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming machinery or related products and machinery or related product recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring. 5. Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related product which they place on the market or put into service bears at least a designation of the machinery or related product model, series or type, the year of construction, namely the year in which the manufacturing process was completed, and any batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification that exists, or, where the size or nature of the machinery or related product does not allow this, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the machinery or related product. 6. Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and the postal address and website, e-mail address or other digital contact at which they can be contacted, on the machinery or related product or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the machinery or related product. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities. 7. Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related products are accompanied by the instructions for use and the information set out in Annex III. The instructions may be provided in a digital format. Such instructions and information shall clearly describe the product model to which they correspond. When the instructions for use are provided in digital format, the manufacturer shall: (a) mark on the machinery or related product, or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in an accompanying document, how to access the digital instructions; (b) present them in a format that makes it possible for the user to print and download the instructions for use and save them on an electronic device so that he or she can access them at all times, in particular during a breakdown of the machinery or related product; this requirement also applies where the instructions for use are embedded in the software of the machinery or related product; (c) make them accessible online during the expected lifetime of the machinery or related product and for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the machinery or related product. However, at the request of the user at the time of the purchase, the manufacturer shall provide the instructions for use in paper format free of charge within one month. In the case of machinery or a related product intended for non-professional users or that can, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, be used by non-professional users, even if not intended for them, the manufacturer shall provide, in paper format, the safety information that is essential for putting the machinery or related product into service and for using it in a safe way. The instructions for use, the safety information and the information set out in Annex III shall be in a language which can be easily understood by users, as determined by the Member State concerned, and shall be clear, understandable and legible. 8. Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related product is accompanied by the EU declaration of conformity set out in Annex V, Part A or, alternatively, manufacturers shall provide the internet address or machine-readable code where that EU declaration of conformity can be accessed in the instructions for use and the information set out in Annex III. Digital EU declarations of conformity shall be made accessible online for the expected lifetime of the machinery or related product and in any event for at least 10 years after the placing on the market or the putting into service of the machinery or related product. 9. Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that machinery or a related product, which they have placed on the market or put into service is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective actions necessary to bring that machinery or related product into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. Furthermore, where the machinery or related product presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals or to property, and, where applicable, to the environment, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the machinery or related product available on the market, or in which they put it into service, to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective actions taken. 10. Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation, in paper or digital format, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery or related products with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any actions taken to eliminate the risks presented by the machinery or related products, which they have placed on the market or put into service.Obligations of manufacturers of machinery and related products",

Before placing partly completed machinery on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part B. Where compliance of partly completed machinery with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III has been demonstrated in the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part B, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of incorporation in accordance with Article 22. 3. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of incorporation at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the partly completed machinery has been placed on the market. Where relevant, the source code or the programming logic included in the technical documentation shall, upon a reasoned request, be made available to the competent national authorities, if that source code or programming logic is necessary in order for them to be able to check compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 4. Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for partly completed machinery that is part of a series production to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Adequate account shall be taken of changes in the production process, or in the design or characteristics of the partly completed machinery, and changes in the harmonised standards or other technical specifications, or in the common specifications referred to in Article 20, by reference to which the conformity of the partly completed machinery is declared or verified. 5. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery which they place on the market bears at least the designation of the partly completed machinery, the year of construction, namely the year in which the manufacturing process was completed, model and series or type and any batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification that exists, or, where the size or nature of the partly completed machinery does not allow this, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the partly completed machinery. 6. Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and the postal address and website, email address or other digital contact at which they can be contacted, on the partly completed machinery or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the partly completed machinery. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery into machinery and by market surveillance authorities. 7. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery is accompanied by the assembly instructions set out in Annex XI. The assembly instructions may be provided by the manufacturer in digital format. When the assembly instructions are provided in digital format, the manufacturer shall: (a) mark on the partly completed machinery, or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in an accompanying document, how to access the digital assembly instructions; (b) present them in a format that makes it possible for the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery to print and download the assembly instructions and save them on an electronic device so that he or she can access them at all times, in particular during a breakdown of the partly completed machinery; this requirement also applies where the assembly instructions are embedded in the software of the partly completed machinery; (c) make them accessible online for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the partly completed machinery. However, at the request of the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery at the time of purchase, the manufacturer shall provide the assembly instructions in paper format free of charge within one month. The assembly instructions shall be in a language which can be easily understood by the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery, as determined by the Member State concerned, and shall be clear, understandable, and legible. 8. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery is accompanied by the EU declaration of incorporation set out in Annex V, Part B or, alternatively, manufacturers shall provide the internet address or machine readable code where that EU declaration of incorporation can be accessed in the assembly instructions set out in Annex XI. Digital EU declarations of incorporation shall be made accessible online for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the partly completed machinery. 9. Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that partly completed machinery which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective actions necessary to bring that partly completed machinery into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. Furthermore, where the partly completed machinery presents a risk as regards the relevant essential health and safety requirements, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the partly completed machinery available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective actions taken. 10. Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation, in paper or digital format, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the partly completed machinery with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any actions taken to eliminate the risks as regards the relevant essential health and safety requirements presented by the partly completed machinery, which they have placed on the market.Obligations of manufacturers of partly completed machinery",

Where compliance of partly completed machinery with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III has been demonstrated in the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part B, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of incorporation in accordance with Article 22. 3. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of incorporation at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the partly completed machinery has been placed on the market. Where relevant, the source code or the programming logic included in the technical documentation shall, upon a reasoned request, be made available to the competent national authorities, if that source code or programming logic is necessary in order for them to be able to check compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 4. Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for partly completed machinery that is part of a series production to remain in conformity with this Regulation.

When placing partly completed machinery on the market, manufacturers shall ensure that it has been designed and constructed in accordance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 2. Before placing partly completed machinery on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part B. Where compliance of partly completed machinery with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III has been demonstrated in the technical documentation set out in Annex IV, Part B, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of incorporation in accordance with Article 22. 3. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of incorporation at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the partly completed machinery has been placed on the market. Where relevant, the source code or the programming logic included in the technical documentation shall, upon a reasoned request, be made available to the competent national authorities, if that source code or programming logic is necessary in order for them to be able to check compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III. 4. Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for partly completed machinery that is part of a series production to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Adequate account shall be taken of changes in the production process, or in the design or characteristics of the partly completed machinery, and changes in the harmonised standards or other technical specifications, or in the common specifications referred to in Article 20, by reference to which the conformity of the partly completed machinery is declared or verified. 5. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery which they place on the market bears at least the designation of the partly completed machinery, the year of construction, namely the year in which the manufacturing process was completed, model and series or type and any batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification that exists, or, where the size or nature of the partly completed machinery does not allow this, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the partly completed machinery. 6. Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and the postal address and website, email address or other digital contact at which they can be contacted, on the partly completed machinery or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the partly completed machinery. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery into machinery and by market surveillance authorities. 7. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery is accompanied by the assembly instructions set out in Annex XI. The assembly instructions may be provided by the manufacturer in digital format. When the assembly instructions are provided in digital format, the manufacturer shall: (a) mark on the partly completed machinery, or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in an accompanying document, how to access the digital assembly instructions; (b) present them in a format that makes it possible for the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery to print and download the assembly instructions and save them on an electronic device so that he or she can access them at all times, in particular during a breakdown of the partly completed machinery; this requirement also applies where the assembly instructions are embedded in the software of the partly completed machinery; (c) make them accessible online for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the partly completed machinery. However, at the request of the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery at the time of purchase, the manufacturer shall provide the assembly instructions in paper format free of charge within one month. The assembly instructions shall be in a language which can be easily understood by the person who incorporates the partly completed machinery, as determined by the Member State concerned, and shall be clear, understandable, and legible. 8. Manufacturers shall ensure that the partly completed machinery is accompanied by the EU declaration of incorporation set out in Annex V, Part B or, alternatively, manufacturers shall provide the internet address or machine readable code where that EU declaration of incorporation can be accessed in the assembly instructions set out in Annex XI. Digital EU declarations of incorporation shall be made accessible online for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the partly completed machinery. 9.

Furthermore, where the partly completed machinery presents a risk as regards the relevant essential health and safety requirements, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the partly completed machinery available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective actions taken. 10. Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation, in paper or digital format, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the partly completed machinery with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.

For the purposes of notification, a conformity assessment body shall meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 11. 2. A conformity assessment body shall be established under the national law of a Member State and shall have legal personality. 3. A conformity assessment body shall be a third-party body that is independent of the organisation or of the machinery or related product that it assesses. A body belonging to a business association or professional federation representing undertakings involved in the design, manufacture, provision, assembly, use or maintenance of machinery or related products which it assesses, may, on condition that its independence and the absence of any conflict of interest are demonstrated, be considered such a conformity assessment body. 4. A conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, importer, distributor, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of machinery or related products that they assess, nor shall it fulfil any of those roles in relation to partly completed machinery that has been incorporated into the assessed product or be the representative of any of those parties. This shall not preclude the use of assessed machinery or related products that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body or the use of machinery or related products for personal purposes. A conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be directly involved in the design, import, distribution, manufacture, marketing, installation, use or maintenance of the machinery or related products, or represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall in particular apply to consultancy services. A conformity assessment body shall ensure that the activities of its subsidiaries or subcontractors do not affect the confidentiality, objectivity or impartiality of its conformity assessment activities. 5. A conformity assessment body and its personnel shall carry out the conformity assessment activities with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite technical competence in the specific field and shall be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence its judgement or the results of its conformity assessment activities, especially as regards persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of those activities. 6. A conformity assessment body shall be capable of carrying out all the conformity assessment tasks assigned to it by Annexes VII, IX and X and in relation to which it has been notified, regardless of whether those tasks are carried out by the conformity assessment body itself or on its behalf and under its responsibility. At all times, and for each conformity assessment procedure and each kind of machinery or related products for which it has been notified, a conformity assessment body shall have at its disposal the necessary: (a) personnel with technical knowledge and sufficient and appropriate experience to perform the conformity assessment tasks; (b) descriptions of procedures in accordance with which conformity assessment is carried out, ensuring the transparency and the ability of reproduction of those procedures; (c) appropriate policies and procedures to distinguish between tasks that it carries out as a notified body and other activities; (d) procedures for the performance of conformity assessment activities which take due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the machinery or related product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process. A conformity assessment body shall have the means necessary to perform the technical and administrative tasks connected with the conformity assessment activities in an appropriate manner and shall have access to all necessary equipment or facilities. 7. The personnel responsible for carrying out conformity assessment tasks shall have the following: (a) sound technical and vocational training covering all the conformity assessment activities in relation to which the conformity assessment body has been notified; (b) satisfactory knowledge of the requirements of the assessments they carry out and adequate authority to carry out those assessments; (c) appropriate knowledge and understanding of the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III, of the applicable harmonised standards and common specifications referred to in Article 20, and of the relevant provisions of Union harmonisation legislation and of national legislation; (d) the ability to draw up certificates, records and reports demonstrating that conformity assessments have been carried out. 8. The impartiality of a conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall be guaranteed. The remuneration of the top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not depend on the number of conformity assessments carried out or on the results of those assessments. 9. A conformity assessment body shall take out liability insurance unless liability is assumed by the Member State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the conformity assessment. 10. The personnel of a conformity assessment body shall observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out the conformity assessment tasks in accordance with Annexes VII, IX and X, except in relation to the competent authorities of the Member State in which its tasks are carried out. Proprietary rights, intellectual property rights and trade secrets shall be protected. 11. A conformity assessment body shall participate in, or ensure that its personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks are informed of, the relevant standardisation activities and the activities of the notified body coordination group established under Article 42 and shall apply as general guidance the administrative decisions and documents produced as a result of the work of that group.2.

The personnel responsible for carrying out conformity assessment tasks shall have the following: (a) sound technical and vocational training covering all the conformity assessment activities in relation to which the conformity assessment body has been notified; (b) satisfactory knowledge of the requirements of the assessments they carry out and adequate authority to carry out those assessments; (c) appropriate knowledge and understanding of the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III, of the applicable harmonised standards and common specifications referred to in Article 20, and of the relevant provisions of Union harmonisation legislation and of national legislation; (d) the ability to draw up certificates, records and reports demonstrating that conformity assessments have been carried out. 8. The impartiality of a conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall be guaranteed. The remuneration of the top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not depend on the number of conformity assessments carried out or on the results of those assessments. 9. A conformity assessment body shall take out liability insurance unless liability is assumed by the Member State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the conformity assessment. 10. The personnel of a conformity assessment body shall observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out the conformity assessment tasks in accordance with Annexes VII, IX and X, except in relation to the competent authorities of the Member State in which its tasks are carried out. Proprietary rights, intellectual property rights and trade secrets shall be protected. 11. A conformity assessment body shall participate in, or ensure that its personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks are informed of, the relevant standardisation activities and the activities of the notified body coordination group established under Article 42 and shall apply as general guidance the administrative decisions and documents produced as a result of the work of that group.6.

For the purposes of notification, a conformity assessment body shall meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 11. 2. A conformity assessment body shall be established under the national law of a Member State and shall have legal personality. 3. A conformity assessment body shall be a third-party body that is independent of the organisation or of the machinery or related product that it assesses. A body belonging to a business association or professional federation representing undertakings involved in the design, manufacture, provision, assembly, use or maintenance of machinery or related products which it assesses, may, on condition that its independence and the absence of any conflict of interest are demonstrated, be considered such a conformity assessment body. 4. A conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, importer, distributor, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of machinery or related products that they assess, nor shall it fulfil any of those roles in relation to partly completed machinery that has been incorporated into the assessed product or be the representative of any of those parties. This shall not preclude the use of assessed machinery or related products that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body or the use of machinery or related products for personal purposes. A conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be directly involved in the design, import, distribution, manufacture, marketing, installation, use or maintenance of the machinery or related products, or represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall in particular apply to consultancy services. A conformity assessment body shall ensure that the activities of its subsidiaries or subcontractors do not affect the confidentiality, objectivity or impartiality of its conformity assessment activities. 5. A conformity assessment body and its personnel shall carry out the conformity assessment activities with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite technical competence in the specific field and shall be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence its judgement or the results of its conformity assessment activities, especially as regards persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of those activities. 6. A conformity assessment body shall be capable of carrying out all the conformity assessment tasks assigned to it by Annexes VII, IX and X and in relation to which it has been notified, regardless of whether those tasks are carried out by the conformity assessment body itself or on its behalf and under its responsibility.

Where, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the product within the scope of this Regulation does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take appropriate and proportionate corrective action, as provided for in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, to bring the non-compliance to an end or to eliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, minimise the risk specified by the market surveillance authorities within a reasonable period which is commensurate with the nature of the risk referred to in the first subparagraph. The market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. 2.

In such cases, the market surveillance authorities shall ensure that the public, the Commission and the other Member States are informed accordingly, without delay. 5.
