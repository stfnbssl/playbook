ITL develops tests, test methods, reference\n    data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development\n    and productive use of information technology (IT). ITL’s responsibilities include the development\n    of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-\n    effective security of other than national security-related information in federal information\n    systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach\n  efforts in information systems security and privacy and its collaborative activities with industry,\n  government, and academic organizations.\n                      Abstract\n    This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and\n    organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,\n    and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors,\n    natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls\n    are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to\n    manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business\n  needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally,\n  the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective\n    (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance\n    perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the\n    controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology\n  products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.\n                      Keywords\n    Assurance; availability; computer security; confidentiality; control; cybersecurity; FISMA;\n    information security; information system; integrity; personally identifiable information; Privacy\n    Act; privacy controls; privacy functions; privacy requirements; Risk Management Framework;\n    security controls; security functions; security requirements; system; system security.\n                        iii\n                  Acknowledgements\n    This publication was developed by the Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group.

However, holders of patents are not obligated to\n    respond to ITL calls for patents and ITL has not undertaken a patent search in order to identify\n    which, if any, patents may apply to this publication.\n    As of the date of publication and following call(s) for the identification of patent claims whose\n    use may be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements of this publication, no\n    such patent claims have been identified to ITL.\n    No representation is made or implied by ITL that licenses are not required to avoid patent\n    infringement in the use of this publication.\n                        vi\n                    RISK MANAGEMENT\n      Organizations must exercise due diligence in managing information security and privacy risk. This\n      is accomplished, in part, by establishing a comprehensive risk management program that uses\n      the flexibility inherent in NIST publications to categorize systems, select and implement security\n      and privacy controls that meet mission and business needs, assess the effectiveness of the\n      controls, authorize the systems for operation, and continuously monitor the systems. Exercising\n      due diligence and implementing robust and comprehensive information security and privacy risk\n      management programs can facilitate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, executive\n      orders, and governmentwide policies. Risk management frameworks and risk management\n      processes are essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the protection measures\n      necessary to address stakeholder needs and the current threats to organizational operations\n      and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based\n      processes, procedures, methods, and technologies ensures that information systems and\n      organizations have the necessary trustworthiness and resiliency to support essential mission and\n      business functions, the U.S. critical infrastructure, and continuity of government.\n                        vii\n              COMMON SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOUNDATIONS\n      In working with the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards and guidelines\n      required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and\n      private sector organizations to improve information security and privacy, avoid unnecessary and\n      costly duplication of effort, and help ensure that its publications are complementary with the\n      standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a\n      comprehensive and transparent public review and comment process, NIST is engaged in a\n      collaborative partnership with the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of\n      National Intelligence, Department of Defense, Committee on National Security Systems, Federal\n      CIO Council, and Federal Privacy Council to establish a Risk Management Framework (RMF) for\n      information security and privacy for the Federal Government. This common foundation provides\n      the Federal Government and their contractors with cost-effective, flexible, and consistent ways\n      to manage security and privacy risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other\n      organizations, and the Nation. The framework provides a basis for the reciprocal acceptance of\n      security and privacy control assessment evidence and authorization decisions and facilitates\n      information sharing and collaboration. NIST continues to work with public and private sector\n      entities to establish mappings and relationships between the standards and guidelines\n      developed by NIST and those developed by other organizations. NIST anticipates using these\n      mappings and the gaps they identify to improve the control catalog.\n                        viii\n        DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES\n      With a renewed emphasis on the use of trustworthy, secure information systems and supply\n      chain security, it is essential that organizations express their security and privacy requirements\n      with clarity and specificity in order to obtain the systems, components, and services necessary\n      for mission and business success. Accordingly, this publication provides controls in the System\n      and Services Acquisition (SA) and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) families that are directed\n      at developers. The scope of the controls in those families includes information system, system\n      component, and system service development and the associated developers whether the\n      development is conducted internally by organizations or externally through the contracting and\n      acquisition processes. The affected controls in the control catalog include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11,\n      SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, SA-21, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7, SR-8, SR-9, and SR-11.\n                        ix\n            INFORMATION SYSTEMS — A BROAD-BASED PERSPECTIVE\n      As we push computers to “the edge,” building an increasingly complex world of interconnected\n      systems and devices, security and privacy continue to dominate the national dialogue. There is\n      an urgent need to further strengthen the underlying systems, products, and services that we\n      depend on in every sector of the critical infrastructure to ensure that those systems, products,\n      and services are sufficiently trustworthy and provide the necessary resilience to support the\n      economic and national security interests of the United States. NIST Special Publication 800-53,\n      Revision 5, responds to this need by embarking on a proactive and systemic approach to develop\n      and make available to a broad base of public and private sector organizations a comprehensive\n      set of security and privacy safeguarding measures for all types of computing platforms, including\n      general purpose computing systems, cyber-physical systems, cloud systems, mobile systems,\n      industrial control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Safeguarding measures include\n      both security and privacy controls to protect the critical and essential operations and assets of\n      organizations and the privacy of individuals. The objective is to make the systems we depend on\n      more penetration resistant to attacks, limit the damage from those attacks when they occur,\n      and make the systems resilient, survivable, and protective of individuals’ privacy.\n                        x\n                    CONTROL BASELINES\n      The control baselines that have previously been included in NIST Special Publication 800-53 have\n      been relocated to NIST Special Publication 800-53B. SP 800-53B contains security and privacy\n      control baselines for federal information systems and organizations. It provides guidance for\n      tailoring control baselines and for developing overlays to support the security and privacy\n      requirements of stakeholders and their organizations. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides control\n      baselines and guidance for security categorization and security control selection for national\n      security systems.\n                        xi\n                USE OF EXAMPLES IN THIS PUBLICATION\n      Throughout this publication, examples are used to illustrate, clarify, or explain certain items in\n      chapter sections, controls, and control enhancements. These examples are illustrative in nature\n      and are not intended to limit or constrain the application of controls or control enhancements\n      by organizations.\n                        xii\n            FEDERAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT COLLABORATION\n      Federal records management processes have a nexus with certain information security and\n      privacy requirements and controls. For example, records officers may be managing records\n      retention, including when records will be deleted. Collaborating with records officers on the\n      selection and implementation of security and privacy controls related to records management\n      can support consistency and efficiency and ultimately strengthen the organization’s security and\n      privacy posture.\n                        xiii\n                    Table of Contents\n    CHAPTER ONE   INTRODUCTION

edge,” building an increasingly complex world of connected\n    information systems and devices, security and privacy will continue to dominate the national\n    dialogue. In its 2017 report, Task Force on Cyber Deterrence [DSB 2017], the Defense Science\n    Board (DSB) provides a sobering assessment of the current vulnerabilities in the U.S. critical\n    infrastructure and the information systems that support mission-essential operations and assets\n  in the public and private sectors.\n    “…The Task Force notes that the cyber threat to U.S. critical infrastructure is outpacing\n    efforts to reduce pervasive vulnerabilities, so that for the next decade at least the United States\n    must lean significantly on deterrence to address the cyber threat posed by the most capable\n    U.S. adversaries. It is clear that a more proactive and systematic approach to U.S. cyber\n    deterrence is urgently needed…”\n    There is an urgent need to further strengthen the underlying information systems, component\n    products, and services that the Nation depends on in every sector of the critical infrastructure—\n  ensuring that those systems, components, and services are sufficiently trustworthy and provide\n  the necessary resilience to support the economic and national security interests of the United\n  States. This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 responds to the call by the DSB by\n  embarking on a proactive and systemic approach to develop and make available to a broad base\n  of public and private sector organizations a comprehensive set of safeguarding measures for all\n  types of computing platforms, including general purpose computing systems, cyber-physical\n  systems, cloud-based systems, mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, weapons\n  systems, space systems, communications systems, environmental control systems, super\n    computers, and industrial control systems. Those safeguarding measures include implementing\n    security and privacy controls to protect the critical and essential operations and assets of\n    organizations and the privacy of individuals. The objectives are to make the information systems\n    we depend on more penetration-resistant, limit the damage from attacks when they occur,\n    make the systems cyber-resilient and survivable, and protect individuals’ privacy.\n    Revision 5 of this foundational NIST publication represents a multi-year effort to develop the\n    next generation of security and privacy controls that will be needed to accomplish the above\n    objectives. It includes changes to make the controls more usable by diverse consumer groups\n    (e.g., enterprises conducting mission and business functions; engineering organizations\n    developing information systems, IoT devices, and systems-of-systems; and industry partners\n    building system components, products, and services). The most significant changes to this\n    publication include:\n    • Making the controls more outcome-based by removing the entity responsible for satisfying\n    the control (i.e., information system, organization) from the control statement;\n  • Integrating information security and privacy controls into a seamless, consolidated control\n    catalog for information systems and organizations;\n  • Establishing a new supply chain risk management control family;\n    • Separating control selection processes from the controls, thereby allowing the controls to be\n    used by different communities of interest, including systems engineers, security architects,\n    software developers, enterprise architects, systems security and privacy engineers, and\n    mission or business owners;\n                        xv\n    • Removing control baselines and tailoring guidance from the publication and transferring the\n    content to NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations;\n    • Clarifying the relationship between requirements and controls and the relationship between\n    security and privacy controls; and\n  • Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls (e.g., controls to support cyber resiliency,\n    support secure systems design, and strengthen security and privacy governance and\n    accountability) based on the latest threat intelligence and cyber-attack data.\n  In separating the process of control selection from the controls and removing the control\n  baselines, a significant amount of guidance and other informative material previously contained\n  in SP 800-53 was eliminated. That content will be moved to other NIST publications such as SP\n  800-37 (Risk Management Framework) and SP 800-53B during the next update cycle. In the near\n  future, NIST also plans to offer the content of SP 800-53, SP 800-53A, and SP 800-53B to a web-\n  based portal to provide its customers interactive, online access to all control, control baseline,\n  overlay, and assessment information.\n                        xvi\n                      Prologue\n    “…Through the process of risk management, leaders must consider risk to US interests from\n    adversaries using cyberspace to their advantage and from our own efforts to employ the global\n    nature of cyberspace to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations… “\n    “…For operational plans development, the combination of threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts\n    must be evaluated in order to identify important trends and decide where effort should be\n    applied to eliminate or reduce threat capabilities; eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities; and assess,\n    coordinate, and deconflict all cyberspace operations…”\n  “…Leaders at all levels are accountable for ensuring readiness and security to the same degree as\n  in any other domain…\"\n    THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS\n    OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n                    __________\n    “Networking and information technology [are] transforming life in the 21st century, changing\n    the way people, businesses, and government interact. Vast improvements in computing, storage,\n    and communications are creating new opportunities for enhancing our social wellbeing;\n    improving health and health care; eliminating barriers to education and employment; and\n    increasing efficiencies in many sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture.\n    The promise of these new applications often stems from their ability to create, collect, transmit,\n    process, and archive information on a massive scale. However, the vast increase in the quantity\n    of personal information that is being collected and retained, combined with the increased ability\n    to analyze it and combine it with other information, is creating valid concerns about privacy and\n    about the ability of entities to manage these unprecedented volumes of data responsibly…. A key\n    challenge of this era is to assure that growing capabilities to create, capture, store, and process\n    vast quantities of information will not damage the core values of the country….”\n  “…When systems process personal information, whether by collecting, analyzing, generating,\n  disclosing, retaining, or otherwise using the information, they can impact privacy of individuals.\n  System designers need to account for individuals as stakeholders in the overall development of\n  the solution.…Designing for privacy must connect individuals’ privacy desires with system\n  requirements and controls in a way that effectively bridges the aspirations with development….”\n    THE NATIONAL PRIVACY RESEARCH STRATEGY\n    NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL, NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n                        xvii",
