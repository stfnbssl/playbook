The requirements introduced in Clause 4 are referred to as zone\n  and conduit requirements (ZCR). Clause 4 also provides rationale and supplemental guidance\n  on each of the requirements. Figure 1 is a workflow diagram outlining the primary steps\n  required to establish zones and conduits, as well as to assess risk. The steps are numbered\n  to indicate their relationship to the ZCRs.\n      Figure 1 – Workflow diagram outlining the primary steps required\n        to establish zones and conduits, as well as to assess risk\n  4.2\n    ZCR 1: Identify the SUC\n  4.2.1\n      ZCR 1.1: Identify the SUC perimeter and access points\n  4.2.1.1\n      Requirement\n  The organization shall clearly identify the SUC, including clear demarcation of the security\n  perimeter and identification of all access points to the SUC.\n  4.2.1.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Organizations typically own and operate multiple control systems, especially larger\n  organizations with multiple industrial facilities. Any of these control systems may be defined\n  as a SUC. For example, there is generally at least one control system at an industrial facility,\n  but oftentimes there are several systems that control various functions within the facility.\n  This requirement specifies that SUCs are identified for the purpose of performing cyber\n  security analysis. The definition of a SUC is intended to include all IACS assets that are\n  needed to provide a complete automation solution.\n  System inventory, architecture diagrams, network diagrams and dataflows can be used to\n  determine and illustrate the IACS assets that are included in the SUC description.\n  NOTE The SUC can include multiple subsystems such as basic process control systems (BPCSs), distributed\n  control systems (DCSs), safety instrumented systems (SISs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\n  and IACS product supplier’s packages. This could also include emerging technologies such as the industrial\n  Internet of Things (IIoT) or cloud-based solutions.\n  4.3\n    ZCR 2: Initial cyber security risk assessment\n  4.3.1\n      ZCR 2.1: Perform initial cyber security risk assessment\n  4.3.1.1\n      Requirement\n  The organization shall perform a cyber security risk assessment of the SUC or confirm a\n  previous initial cyber security risk assessment is still applicable in order to identify the worst\n  case unmitigated cyber security risk that could result from the interference with, breach or\n  disruption of, or disablement of mission critical IACS operations.\n  4.3.1.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The purpose of the initial cyber security risk assessment is to gain an initial understanding of\n  the worst-case risk the SUC presents to the organization should it be compromised. This is\n  typically evaluated in terms of impacts to health, safety, environmental, business interruption,\n  production loss, product quality, financial, legal, regulatory, reputation, etc. This assessment\n  assists with the prioritization of detailed risk assessments and facilitates the grouping of\n  assets into zones and conduits within the SUC.\n  For potentially hazardous processes, the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and\n  functional safety assessments as defined in IEC 61511-2 [8] should be referenced as part of\n  the initial cyber security risk assessment to identify worst-case impacts. Organizations should\n  also take into consideration threat intelligence from governments, sector specific Information\n  Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and other relevant sources.\n  Assessment of initial risk is often accomplished using a risk matrix that establishes the\n  relationship between likelihood, impact and risk (such as, a corporate risk matrix). Examples\n  of risk matrices can be found in Annex B.\n  4.4\n    ZCR 3: Partition the SUC into zones and conduits\n  4.4.1\n      Overview\n  Subclauses 4.4.2 through 4.8.1 describe the ZCRs for partitioning the SUC into zones and\n  conduits and provide rationale and supplemental guidance for each requirement. Subclause\n  4.4.2, sets out the base requirement for establishing zones and conduits within the SUC.\n  Subclauses 4.4.3 through 4.4.7 are intended to provide guidance on assignment of assets to\n  zones based upon industry best practices. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.\n  4.4.2\n      ZCR 3.1: Establish zones and conduits\n  4.4.2.1\n      Requirement\n  The organization shall group IACS and related assets into zones or conduits as determined by\n  risk. Grouping shall be based upon the results of the initial cyber security risk assessment or\n  other criteria, such as criticality of assets, operational function, physical or logical location,\n  required access (for example, least privilege principles) or responsible organization.\n  4.4.2.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The intention of grouping assets into zones and conduits is to identify those assets which\n  share common security requirements and to permit the identification of common security\n  measures required to mitigate risk. The assignment of IACS assets to zones and conduits\n  may be adjusted based upon the results of the detailed risk assessment. This is a general\n  requirement, but special attention should be given to the safety related systems including\n  safety instrumented systems, wireless systems, systems directly connected to Internet\n  endpoints, systems that interface to the IACS but are managed by other entities (including\n  external systems) and mobile devices.\n  For example, a facility might first be divided into operational areas, such as materials storage,\n  processing, finishing, etc. Operational areas can often be further divided into functional layers,\n  such as manufacturing execution systems (MESs), supervisory systems (for example, human\n  machine interfaces [HMIs]), primary control systems (for example, BPCS, DCS, remote\n  terminal units [RTUs] and programmable logic controllers [PLCs]) and safety systems. Models\n  such as the Purdue reference model as defined in IEC 62264-1 [9] are often used as a basis\n  for this division. IACS product supplier reference architectures can also be helpful.\n  4.4.3\n      ZCR 3.2: Separate business and IACS assets\n  4.4.3.1\n      Requirement\n  IACS assets shall be grouped into zones that are logically or physically separated from\n  business or enterprise system assets.\n  4.4.3.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Business and IACS are two different types of systems that need to be divided into separate\n  zones as their functionality, responsible organization, results of initial risk assessment and\n  location are often fundamentally different. It is important to understand the basic difference\n  between business and IACS, and the ability of IACS to impact health, safety and environment\n  (HSE).\n  4.4.4\n      ZCR 3.3: Separate safety related assets\n  4.4.4.1\n      Requirement\n  Safety related IACS assets shall be grouped into zones that are logically or physically\n  separated from zones with non-safety related IACS assets. However, if they cannot be\n  separated, the entire zone shall be identified as a safety related zone.\n  4.4.4.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Safety related IACS assets usually have different security requirements than basic control\n  system components or systems, and components interfaced to the control system\n  components. Safety related zones typically require a higher-level of security protection due to\n  the higher potential for health, safety and environmental consequences if the zone is\n  compromised.\n  4.4.5\n      ZCR 3.4: Separate temporarily connected devices\n  4.4.5.1\n      Recommendation\n  Devices that are permitted to make temporary connections to the SUC should be grouped into\n  a separate zone or zones from assets that are intended to be permanently connected to the\n  IACS.\n  4.4.5.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Devices that are temporarily connected to the SUC (for example, maintenance portable\n  computers, portable processing equipment, portable security appliances and universal serial\n  bus [USB] devices) are more likely exposed to a different and wider variety of threats than\n  devices that are permanently part of the zone. Therefore, these devices should be modelled in\n  a separate zone or zones. The primary concern with these devices is that, because of the\n  temporary nature of the connection, they may also be able to connect to other networks\n  outside the zone. However, there are exceptions. For example, a hand-held device that is only\n  used within a single zone and never leaves the physical boundary of the zone may be\n  included in the zone.\n  4.4.6\n      ZCR 3.5: Separate wireless devices\n  4.4.6.1\n      Recommendation\n  Wireless devices should be in one or more zones that are separated from wired devices.\n  4.4.6.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Wireless signals are not controlled by fences or cabinets and are therefore more accessible\n  than normal wired networks. Because of this increased access potential, they are more likely\n  exposed to a different and wider variety of threats than devices that are wired.\n  Typically, a wireless access point is modelled as the conduit between a wireless zone and a\n  wired zone. Depending upon the capabilities of the wireless access point additional security\n  controls (for example, firewall) may be required to provide appropriate level of separation.\n  4.4.7\n      ZCR 3.6: Separate devices connected via external networks\n  4.4.7.1\n      Recommendation\n  Devices that are permitted to make connections to the SUC via networks external to the SUC\n  should be grouped into a separate zone or zones.\n  4.4.7.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is not uncommon for organizations to grant remote access to personnel such as employees,\n  suppliers and other business partners for maintenance, optimization and reporting purposes.\n  Because remote access is outside the physical boundary of the SUC, it should be modelled as\n  a separate zone or zones with its own security requirements.\n  4.5\n    ZCR 4: Risk comparison\n  4.5.1\n      Overview\n  Subclause 4.5.2 includes one ZCR to compare initial risk to tolerable risk.\n  4.5.2\n      ZCR 4.1: Compare initial risk to tolerable risk\n  4.5.2.1\n      Requirement\n  The initial risk determined in 4.3 shall be compared to the organization’s tolerable risk. If the\n  initial risk exceeds the tolerable risk, the organization shall perform a detailed cyber security\n  risk assessment as defined in 4.6.\n  4.5.2.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The purpose of this step is to determine if the initial risk is tolerable or requires further\n  mitigation.\n  4.6\n    ZCR 5: Perform a detailed cyber security risk assessment\n  4.6.1\n      Overview\n  This ZCR discusses the detailed risk assessment requirements for an IACS and provides\n  rationale and supplemental guidance on each requirement. The requirements in this ZCR\n  apply to every zone and conduit. If zones or conduits share similar threat(s), consequences\n  and/or similar assets, it is allowable to analyse groups of zones or conduits together if such\n  grouping enables optimized analysis. It is permissible to use existing results if the zone is\n  standardized (for example, replication of multiple instances of a reference design). The\n  flowchart shown in Figure 2 illustrates the cyber security risk assessment workflow.\n  Any detailed risk assessment methodology (such as, ISO 31000 [14], NIST SP 800-39 [16],\n  and ISO/IEC 27005 [12]) may be followed provided the risk assessment requirements are\n  satisfied by the methodology selected. The initial and detailed risk assessment methodologies\n  should be derived from the same framework, standard or source and have to use a consistent\n  risk ranking scale in order to produce consistent and coherent results.\n    Figure 2 – Detailed cyber security risk assessment workflow per zone or conduit\n  4.6.2\n      ZCR 5.1: Identify threats\n  4.6.2.1\n      Requirement\n  A list of the threats that could affect the assets contained within the zone or conduit shall be\n  developed.\n  4.6.2.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important to prepare a comprehensive and realistic list of threats in order to perform a\n  security risk assessment. A threat description should include but is not limited to the following:\n  a) a description of the threat source;\n  b) a description of the capability or skill-level of the threat source;\n  c) a description of possible threat vectors;\n  d) an identification of the potentially affected asset(s).\n  Some examples of threat descriptions are:\n  •\n  A non-malicious employee physically accesses the process control zone and plugs a USB\n  memory stick into one of the computers;\n  •\n  An authorized support person logically accesses the process control zone using an\n  infected laptop; and\n  •\n  A non-malicious employee opens a phishing email compromising their access credentials.\n  Given the potential for a large number of possible threats, it is acceptable to summarize by\n  grouping sources, assets, entry points, etc. into classes.\n  4.6.3\n      ZCR 5.2: Identify vulnerabilities\n  4.6.3.1\n      Requirement\n  The zone or conduit shall be analysed in order to identify and document the known\n  vulnerabilities associated with the assets contained within the zone or conduit including the\n  access points.\n  4.6.3.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  In order for a threat to be successful, it is necessary to exploit one or more vulnerabilities in\n  an asset. Therefore, it is necessary to identify known vulnerabilities associated with the\n  assets to better understand threat vectors.\n  A generally accepted approach to identifying vulnerabilities in an IACS is to perform a\n  vulnerability assessment. Additional information on IACS cyber security vulnerability\n  assessments is available in ISA-TR84.00.09 [15].\n  Additionally, there are numerous sources of information regarding known and common\n  vulnerabilities in IACS, such as the industrial control system computer emergency response\n  team (ICS-CERT), IACS product suppliers, etc.\n  4.6.4\n      ZCR 5.3: Determine consequence and impact\n  4.6.4.1\n      Requirement\n  Each threat scenario shall be evaluated to determine the consequence and the impact should\n  the threat be realized. Consequences should be documented in terms of the worst-case\n  impact on risk areas such as personnel safety, financial loss, business interruption and\n  environment.\n  4.6.4.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Estimating the worst-case impact of a cyber threat is an important input in performing the\n  cost/benefit analysis of security controls. If the worst-case impact is low, the risk assessment\n  team may decide to proceed to the next threat.\n  Existing PHA and other related risk assessments (such as, information technology, functional\n  safety, business and physical security) should be reviewed to assist in determining\n  consequences and impact.\n  The measure of impact may be qualitative or quantitative. One method is to use a\n  consequence scale that is defined by the organization as part of their risk management\n  system (refer to Annex B for examples).\n  4.6.5\n      ZCR 5.4: Determine unmitigated likelihood\n  4.6.5.1\n      Requirement\n  Each threat shall be evaluated to determine the unmitigated likelihood. This is the likelihood\n  that the threat will materialize.\n  4.6.5.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  In risk management terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to refer to the chance of\n  something happening, whether defined, measured or determined objectively or subjectively,\n  qualitatively or quantitatively, and described using general terms or mathematically (such as,\n  a probability or a frequency over a given time period). A common method of estimating\n  likelihood is to use a semi-quantitative likelihood scale that is defined by the organization as\n  part of their risk management system (refer to Annex B for examples). Either qualitative or\n  quantitative methods are allowed by this document.\n  A number of factors are considered when estimating unmitigated likelihood such as the\n  motivation and capability of the threat source, the history of similar threats, known\n  vulnerabilities, the attractiveness of the target, etc.\n  Existing cyber security countermeasures for the zone or conduit being evaluated should not\n  be considered when determining unmitigated likelihood; they should be hypothetically\n  eliminated. However, the likelihood determination recognizes countermeasures that are\n  inherent to IACS components and any non-cyber independent protection layers (IPLs) such as\n  physical security, mechanical safeguards (such as, pressure safety valves) or emergency\n  procedures that are in place to reduce the likelihood.\n  Likelihood is evaluated twice during the detailed risk assessment process. It is initially\n  determined without consideration for any existing countermeasures in order to establish the\n  unmitigated\n        risk.\n          It\n            will\n                be\n                  re-evaluated\n                        in\n                          4.6.10,\n                                taking\n                                    into\n                                      account\n                                          existing\n  countermeasures and their effectiveness in order to determine residual risk.\n  Consequence-only risk assessment methodologies may be used to meet the requirements of\n  this document. These methodologies typically do not factor likelihood into the determination of\n  unmitigated cyber risk and implicitly assume that likelihood is constant (such as, assuming the\n  likelihood is ever present or quantitatively a ‘1’).\n  4.6.6\n      ZCR 5.5: Determine unmitigated cyber security risk\n  4.6.6.1\n      Requirement\n  The unmitigated cyber security risk for each threat shall be determined by combining the\n  impact measure determined in 4.6.4, and the unmitigated likelihood measure determined in\n  4.6.5.\n  4.6.6.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Determination of unmitigated cyber security risk is often accomplished using a risk matrix that\n  establishes the relationship between likelihood, impact and risk, such as a corporate risk\n  matrix (refer to Annex B for examples).\n  4.6.7\n      ZCR 5.6: Determine SL-T\n  4.6.7.1\n      Requirement\n  A SL-T shall be established for each security zone or conduit.\n  4.6.7.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  SL-T is the desired level of security for a particular IACS, zone or conduit. It is established to\n  clearly communicate this information to those responsible for designing, implementing,\n  operating and maintaining cyber security.\n  SL-T may be expressed as a single value or a vector. Refer to IEC 62443-3-3:2013, Annex A\n  for a discussion of the SL vector approach.\n  There is no prescribed method for establishing SL-T. Some organizations chose to establish\n  SL-T based upon the difference between the unmitigated cyber security risk and tolerable risk.\n  Whereas others elect to establish SL-T based on the SL definitions provided in Annex A of\n  this document and IEC 62443-3-3:2013. Another approach, if a risk matrix is used (see\n  Annex B for examples), is to qualitatively establish the SL. Starting from a reasonable\n  estimate of SL (can also be none) the cyber security risk is evaluated by the risk matrix taking\n  into account the countermeasures implied by the SL. If the risk is not acceptable, then the SL\n  is raised (this means additional countermeasures are added) until the cyber security risk is\n  acceptable. The SL derived from this analysis becomes SL-T.\n  4.6.8\n      ZCR 5.7: Compare unmitigated risk with tolerable risk\n  4.6.8.1\n      Requirement\n  The unmitigated risk determined for each threat identified in 4.6.6, shall be compared to the\n  organization’s tolerable risk. If the unmitigated risk exceeds the tolerable risk, the\n  organization shall determine whether to accept, transfer or mitigate the risk. To mitigate the\n  risk, continue to evaluate the threat by completing 4.6.9 through 4.6.13. Otherwise, the\n  organization may document the results in 4.6.14 and proceed to the next threat.\n  4.6.8.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The purpose of this step is to determine if the unmitigated risk is tolerable or requires further\n  evaluation.\n  4.6.9\n      ZCR 5.8: Identify and evaluate existing countermeasures\n  4.6.9.1\n      Requirement\n  Existing countermeasures in the SUC shall be identified and evaluated to determine the\n  effectiveness of the countermeasures to reduce the likelihood or impact.\n  4.6.9.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  In order to determine residual risk, the likelihood and impact should be evaluated taking into\n  account the presence and effectiveness of existing countermeasures. This step in the process\n  focuses on identifying and evaluating existing countermeasures.\n  IEC 62443-3-3 provides guidance on types of countermeasures and their effectiveness by\n  assigning a capability SL (SL-C) to each system requirement.\n  4.6.10\n      ZCR 5.9: Reevaluate likelihood and impact\n  4.6.10.1\n      Requirement\n  The likelihood and impact shall be re-evaluated considering the countermeasures and their\n  effectiveness.\n  4.6.10.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The unmitigated likelihood determined in 4.6.5 does not account for existing countermeasures.\n  In this step, countermeasures such as technical, administrative or procedural controls are\n  considered and used to determine mitigated likelihood. Likewise, the consequences and\n  impact determined in 4.6.4 should also be re-evaluated considering the identified\n  countermeasures.\n  4.6.11\n      ZCR 5.10: Determine residual risk\n  4.6.11.1\n      Requirement\n  The residual risk for each threat identified in 4.6.2, shall be determined by combining the\n  mitigated likelihood measure and mitigated impact values determined in 4.6.10.\n  4.6.11.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Determining residual risk provides a measure of the current level of risk as well as a measure\n  of the effectiveness of existing countermeasures. It is an essential step in determining\n  whether the current level of risk exceeds tolerable risk guidelines.\n  4.6.12\n      ZCR 5.11: Compare residual risk with tolerable risk\n  4.6.12.1\n      Requirement\n  The residual risk determined for each threat identified in 4.6.2, ZCR 5.1: Identify threats, shall\n  be compared to the organization’s tolerable risk. If the residual risk exceeds the tolerable risk,\n  the organization shall determine if the residual risk will be accepted, transferred or mitigated\n  based upon the organization’s policy.\n  4.6.12.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The purpose of this step is to determine if the residual risk is tolerable or requires further\n  mitigation. Many organizations define tolerable risk in their risk management policies.\n  4.6.13\n      ZCR 5.12: Identify additional cyber security countermeasures\n  4.6.13.1\n      Requirement\n  Additional cyber security countermeasures such as technical, administrative or procedural\n  controls shall be identified to mitigate the risks where the residual risk exceeds the\n  organization’s tolerable risk unless the organization has elected to tolerate or transfer the risk.\n  4.6.13.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  When residual risk exceeds an organization's risk tolerance, steps need to be taken to reduce\n  the risk to tolerable levels.\n  Countermeasures are applied to reduce risk. Cyber security countermeasures may be a\n  combination of technical and non-technical (such as, policies and procedures). Another\n  means of reducing risk is to reallocate an IACS asset from a lower security to a higher\n  security zone or conduit in order to take advantage of the security countermeasures of the\n  higher security zone or conduit.\n  IEC 62443-3-3 can be used as a guide to select appropriate technical countermeasures. The\n  countermeasures identified in IEC 62443-3-3 have been assigned a SL-C rating which is\n  beneficial in evaluating the effectiveness of the countermeasure.\n  Users may also want to evaluate the cost and complexity of countermeasures as part of the\n  design process.\n  4.6.14\n      ZCR 5.13: Document and communicate results\n  4.6.14.1\n      Requirement\n  The results of the detailed cyber risk assessment shall be documented, reported and made\n  available to the appropriate stakeholders in the organization. Appropriate information security\n  classification shall be assigned to protect the confidentiality of the documentation.\n  Documentation shall include the date each session was conducted as well as the names and\n  titles of the participants. Documentation that was instrumental in performing the cyber risk\n  assessment (such as, system architecture diagrams, PHAs, vulnerability assessments, gap\n  assessments and sources of threat information) shall be recorded and archived along with the\n  cyber risk assessment.\n  4.6.14.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Cyber security risk assessments should be documented and made available to the\n  appropriate personnel in the organization. Cyber security risk assessments are living\n  documents that may be used for multiple purposes including testing, auditing and future risk\n  assessments. However, it is also important to properly protect this information as it often\n  contains sensitive details about the systems, known vulnerabilities and existing safeguards.\n  4.7\n    ZCR 6: Document cyber security requirements, assumptions and constraints\n  4.7.1\n      Overview\n  Subclauses 4.7.2 through 4.7.10 describe the requirements for documenting cyber security\n  requirements, assumptions and constraints within the SUC as needed to achieve the SL-T\n  and provides rationale and supplemental guidance for each requirement.\n  4.7.2\n      ZCR 6.1: Cyber security requirements specification\n  4.7.2.1\n      Requirement\n  A cyber security requirements specification (CRS) shall be created to document mandatory\n  security countermeasures of the SUC based on the outcome of the detailed risk assessment\n  as well as general security requirements based upon company or site-specific policies,\n  standards and relevant regulations.\n  At a minimum, the CRS shall include the following:\n  •\n  ZCR 6.2: SUC description (see 4.7.3);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.3: Zone and conduit drawings (see 4.7.4);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.4: Zone and conduit characteristics (see 4.7.5);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.5: Operating environment assumptions (see 4.7.6);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.6: Threat environment(see 4.7.7);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.7: Organizational security policies (see 4.7.8);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.8: Tolerable risk (see 4.7.9);\n  •\n  ZCR 6.9: Regulatory requirements (see 4.7.10).\n  4.7.2.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Cyber security requirements should be documented in order to ensure the requirements are\n  clearly communicated to all stakeholders and are properly implemented. The CRS does not\n  need to be a single document. Many organizations create a cyber security requirements\n  section in other IACS documents.\n  NOTE ISA-TR84.00.09 provides additional guidance on the recommended elements in a CRS.\n  4.7.3\n      ZCR 6.2: SUC description\n  4.7.3.1\n      Requirement\n  A high-level description and depiction of the SUC shall be included in the CRS. At a minimum,\n  the CRS shall include the name, a high-level description of the function and the intended\n  usage of the SUC, as well as, a description of the equipment or process under control.\n  4.7.3.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important to clearly identify and define the scope of the SUC in the CRS. This\n  requirement ensures a minimum amount of information is provided. An illustration of the SUC\n  and the associated data flows and process flows should be included.\n  4.7.4\n      ZCR 6.3: Zone and conduit drawings\n  4.7.4.1\n      Requirement\n  The organization shall:\n  a) Produce a drawing or a set of drawings that illustrates the zone and conduit partitioning of\n  the entire SUC.\n  b) Assign each asset in the SUC to a zone or a conduit.\n  4.7.4.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important to have an overview drawing of the SUC that illustrates the zone and conduit\n  boundaries and the assets contained within those boundaries in order to effectively\n  communicate how the SUC is partitioned.\n  4.7.5\n      ZCR 6.4: Zone and conduit characteristics\n  4.7.5.1\n      Requirement\n  The following items shall be identified and documented for each defined zone and conduit:\n  a) Name and/or unique identifier;\n  b) Accountable organization(s);\n  c) Definition of logical boundary;\n  d) Definition of physical boundary, if applicable;\n  e) Safety designation;\n  f)\n  List of all logical access points;\n  g) List of all physical access points;\n  h) List of data flows associated with each access point;\n  i)\n  Connected zones or conduits;\n  j)\n  List of assets and their classification, criticality and business value;\n  k) SL-T;\n  l) Applicable security requirements;\n  m) Applicable security policies; and\n  n) Assumptions and external dependencies.\n  4.7.5.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important to characterize and document the attributes of a zone or conduit. Each of the\n  items listed in the above requirements has a specific purpose, as described below:\n  a) Name and/or unique identifier – It is important for design and documentation purposes to\n  be able to uniquely identify each zone or conduit.\n  b) Accountable organization(s) – The accountable organization is the person, group or\n  groups who are responsible and accountable for the security of the zone or conduit.\n  NOTE The accountable and responsible organizations can be different. If so, they will both be identified.\n  c) Logical boundary – The logical boundary is important because it delineates the boundary\n  between the zone or conduit and the rest of the system. It also helps identify the\n  demarcation point for all communications entering or exiting the zone or conduit.\n  d) Physical boundary – It is important to document the physical boundary if the zone or\n  conduit requires physical security to achieve its SL-T. If physical security could enhance\n  (but is not required) the SL-T, it should preferably be documented.\n  e) Safety Designation – It is important to identify if the zone or conduit is safety related or\n  contains safety related assets.\n  f) List of logical access points – Logical access points are any place where electronic\n  information can cross the logical boundary of a zone or conduit. Logical access points\n  need to be identified and documented as they may have vulnerabilities that can be\n  exploited by threats.\n  g) List of physical access points – Physical access points (for example, fences, doors and\n  enclosures) are any place where personnel can gain physical access to zone or conduit\n  assets. Physical access points need to be identified and documented to determine\n  appropriate means of monitoring and preventing unauthorized access.\n  h) List of data flows – In order to detect anomalies, it is important to identify and document\n  the expected flow of data (for example, source, destination and protocol) throughout the\n  system and, in particular, the flow of data in and out of a zone or conduit.\n  i) Connected zones or conduits – It is important to identify the connectivity between zones\n  and conduits in order to identify all of the logical access points into and within the system.\n  Typically, this is illustrated in a zone and conduit diagram.\n  j) List of assets and their classification, criticality and business value – It is important to\n  identify the IACS assets contained within each zone or conduit and their classification,\n  criticality and business value in order to develop an understanding of the consequences\n  should that zone or conduit be compromised. When identifying consequences, it is\n  important to consider the consequences to other zones/conduits as well as the\n  zone/conduit in question.\n  k) SL-T – The SL-T communicates the level of protection required for a zone or conduit\n  based upon the results of the risk assessment. Refer to 4.6.7 for further information.\n  l) Applicable security requirements – For each zone and conduit it is necessary to identify\n  the applicable security requirements needed to achieve the SL-T. Some requirements may\n  be common to all zones or conduits in the SUC while others may be specific.\n  NOTE Security requirements specification cannot be finalized until after completion of the detailed risk\n  assessment (refer to 4.6).\n  m) Applicable security policies – For each zone and conduit, it is necessary to identify the\n  applicable organizational security policies needed to achieve the SL-T. Some policies may\n  be common to all zones or conduits in the SUC while others may be specific.\n  n) Assumptions and external dependencies – Oftentimes, the security of a zone or conduit is\n  dependent upon factors outside of the zone or conduit, such as clean power and additional\n  layers of physical and network security. These assumptions and interdependencies should\n  be documented.\n  4.7.6\n      ZCR 6.5: Operating environment assumptions\n  4.7.6.1\n      Requirement\n  The CRS shall identify and document the physical and logical environment in which the SUC\n  is located or planned to be located.\n  4.7.6.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  The physical environment for the SUC should be documented in order to ensure the IACS\n  assets are properly protected. Examples of documentation that can be used to communicate\n  the physical environment would be site maps, floor plans, wiring schematics, connector\n  configurations and site security plans. Existing security vulnerability assessments should also\n  be referenced.\n  The logical environment for the SUC also should be documented to provide a clear\n  understanding of the networks, information technology, protocols and IACS systems that may\n  interface with the SUC. Examples of relevant documentation would be network architecture\n  diagrams, system architecture diagrams, electrical one-lines, heating, ventilation and air-\n  conditioning (HVAC) hook-ups, fire and gas detection and suppression, and other relevant\n  design documents.\n  4.7.7\n      ZCR 6.6: Threat environment\n  4.7.7.1\n      Requirement\n  The CRS shall include a description of the threat environment that impacts the SUC. The\n  description shall include the source(s) of threat intelligence and include both current and\n  emerging threats.\n  4.7.7.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  There are a number of factors that can affect the threat environment of a SUC, including the\n  geo-political climate, the physical environment and the sensitivity of the system. Examples of\n  appropriate authoritative sources can include:\n  •\n  computer emergency response teams (CERTs);\n  •\n  ICS-CERT;\n  •\n  public-private partnerships such as ISACs;\n  •\n  IACS product suppliers;\n  •\n  industry advisory groups;\n  •\n  government agencies such as an information security agency;\n  •\n  threat intelligence services.\n  4.7.8\n      ZCR 6.7: Organizational security policies\n  4.7.8.1\n      Requirement\n  Security countermeasures and features that implement the organizational security policies\n  shall be included in the CRS.\n  4.7.8.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important that all systems incorporate the baseline security policies established by the\n  organization.\n  4.7.9\n      ZCR 6.8: Tolerable risk\n  4.7.9.1\n      Requirement\n  The organization’s tolerable risk for the SUC shall be included in the CRS.\n  4.7.9.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  It is important that stakeholders are aware of the organization’s established tolerable risk\n  level in order to ensure that the SUC risk level is in alignment.\n  4.7.10\n      ZCR 6.9: Regulatory requirements\n  4.7.10.1\n      Requirement\n  Any relevant cyber security regulatory requirements that apply to the SUC shall be included in\n  the CRS.\n  4.7.10.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  This is important to ensure regulatory compliance.\n  4.8\n    ZCR 7: Asset owner approval\n  4.8.1\n      Overview\n  Subclause 4.8.2 includes one ZCR to attain asset owner approval.\n  4.8.2\n      ZCR 7.1: Attain asset owner approval\n  4.8.2.1\n      Requirement\n  Asset owner management who are accountable for the safety, integrity and reliability of the\n  process controlled by the SUC shall review and approve the results of the risk assessment.\n  4.8.2.2\n      Rationale and supplemental guidance\n  Risk assessments are often facilitated by third-parties with participation by various subject\n  matter experts who have intimate knowledge of the operation of the industrial process and the\n  functionality of the IACS and related IT systems. While these personnel have the knowledge\n  and skills to perform the risk assessment, they typically do not have the authority to make\n  decisions to accept risk. Therefore, the results of the assessment have to be presented to the\n  appropriate management with the authority to make such decisions.",

    "  Organizations typically own and operate multiple control systems, especially larger",
    "  organizations with multiple industrial facilities. Any of these control systems may be defined",
    "  as a SUC. For example, there is generally at least one control system at an industrial facility,",
    "  but oftentimes there are several systems that control various functions within the facility.",
