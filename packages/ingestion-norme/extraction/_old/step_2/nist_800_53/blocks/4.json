For federal\n    information security and privacy policies, the term requirement is generally used to refer to\n    information security and privacy obligations imposed on organizations. For example, [OMB A-\n    130] imposes information security and privacy requirements with which federal agencies must\n    comply when managing information resources. The term requirement can also be used in a\n    broader sense to refer to an expression of stakeholder protection needs for a particular system\n    or organization. Stakeholder protection needs and the corresponding security and privacy\n    requirements may be derived from many sources (e.g., laws, executive orders, directives,\n    regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments). The term\n    requirement, as used in this guideline, includes both legal and policy requirements, as well as an\n    expression of the broader set of stakeholder protection needs that may be derived from other\n    sources. All of these requirements, when applied to a system, help determine the necessary\n    characteristics of the system—encompassing security, privacy, and assurance.24\n    Organizations may divide security and privacy requirements into more granular categories,\n    depending on where the requirements are employed in the system development life cycle\n    (SDLC) and for what purpose. Organizations may use the term capability requirement to describe\n    a capability that the system or organization must provide to satisfy a stakeholder protection\n    need. In addition, organizations may refer to system requirements that pertain to particular\n    hardware, software, and firmware components of a system as specification requirements—that\n    is, capabilities that implement all or part of a control and that may be assessed (i.e., as part of\n    the verification, validation, testing, and evaluation processes). Finally, organizations may use the\n    term statement of work requirements to refer to actions that must be performed operationally\n    or during system development.\n    24 The system characteristics that impact security and privacy vary and include the system type and function in terms\n    of its primary purpose; the system make-up in terms of its technology, mechanical, physical, and human elements;\n    the modes and states within which the system delivers its functions and services; the criticality or importance of the\n    system and its constituent functions and services; the sensitivity of the data or information processed, stored, or\n    transmitted; the consequence of loss, failure, or degradation relative to the ability of the system to execute correctly\n    and to provide for its own protection (i.e., self-protection); and monetary or other value [SP 800-160-1].\n    Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\n    for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and reflecting the\n    protection needs of organizational stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented by the\n    organization in order to satisfy the system requirements. Controls can include administrative,\n    technical, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control\n    may necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements\n  or instantiated control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter\n  values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail for particular\n  controls within the SDLC.\n    2.2   CONTROL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION\n    Security and privacy controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and\n  structure. For ease of use in the security and privacy control selection and specification process,\n    controls are organized into 20 families.25 Each family contains controls that are related to the\n    specific topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family\n  (e.g., PS for Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy,\n    oversight, supervision, manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by\n  systems or actions by individuals. Table 1 lists the security and privacy control families and their\n  associated family identifiers.\n              TABLE 1: SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL FAMILIES\n    ID\n              FAMILY\n                          ID\n                                    FAMILY\n    AC\n        Access Control\n                          PE\n                              Physical and Environmental Protection\n    AT\n        Awareness and Training\n                          PL\n                              Planning\n    AU\n        Audit and Accountability\n                          PM\n                              Program Management\n    CA\n        Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring\n                          PS\n                              Personnel Security\n    CM\n        Configuration Management\n                          PT\n                              PII Processing and Transparency\n    CP\n        Contingency Planning\n                          RA\n                              Risk Assessment\n    IA\n        Identification and Authentication\n                          SA\n                              System and Services Acquisition\n    IR\n        Incident Response\n                          SC\n                              System and Communications Protection\n    MA\n        Maintenance\n                          SI\n                              System and Information Integrity\n    MP\n        Media Protection\n                          SR\n                              Supply Chain Risk Management\n    Families of controls contain base controls and control enhancements, which are directly related\n    to their base controls. Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base\n    control or increase the strength of a base control. Control enhancements are used in systems\n  and environments of operation that require greater protection than the protection provided by\n  the base control. The need for organizations to select and implement control enhancements is\n    due to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require\n    additions to the base control functionality or assurance based on assessments of risk. The\n    25 Of the 20 control families in NIST SP 800-53, 17 are aligned with the minimum security requirements in [FIPS 200].\n    The Program Management (PM), PII Processing and Transparency (PT), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)\n    families address enterprise-level program management, privacy, and supply chain risk considerations pertaining to\n  federal mandates emergent since [FIPS 200].\n    selection and implementation of control enhancements always requires the selection and\n    implementation of the base control.\n    The families are arranged in alphabetical order, while the controls and control enhancements\n    within each family are in numerical order. The order of the families, controls, and control\n    enhancements does not imply any logical progression, level of prioritization or importance, or\n    order in which the controls or control enhancements are to be implemented. Rather, it reflects\n    the order in which they were included in the catalog. Control designations are not re-used when\n    a control is withdrawn.\n    Security and privacy controls have the following structure: a base control section, a discussion\n  section, a related controls section, a control enhancements section, and a references section.\n  Figure 1 illustrates the structure of a typical control.\n                  FIGURE 1: CONTROL STRUCTURE\n    The control section prescribes a security or privacy capability to be implemented. Security and\n    privacy capabilities are achieved by the activities or actions, automated or nonautomated,\n    carried out by information systems and organizations. Organizations designate the responsibility\n    for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring. Organizations have the\n    AU-4\n        AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY\n        Control:  Allocate audit record storage capacity to accommodate [Assignment: organization-\n        defined audit record retention requirements].\n        Discussion:  Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit\n        processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit\n        storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the\n        potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.\n        Related Controls:  AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12, AU-14, SI-4.\n        Control Enhancements:\n        (1)\n          AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY | TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE\n          Off-load audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto a different\n          system or media than the system being audited.\n          Discussion:  Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and\n          integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary system to a secondary\n          or alternate system. It is a common process in systems with limited audit storage\n          capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can\n          communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit\n          records, at which point the information is transferred.\n          Related Controls:  None.\n        References:  None.\n  Base\n  Control\n                                Organization-defined Parameter\n  Control\n  Enhancement\n                  Sources for additional information related to the control\n                                Organization-defined Parameter\n  Control Identifier\n              Control Name\n    flexibility to implement the controls selected in whatever manner that satisfies organizational\n    mission or business needs consistent with law, regulation, and policy.\n    The discussion section provides additional information about a control. Organizations can use\n    the information as needed when developing, tailoring, implementing, assessing, or monitoring\n    controls. The information provides important considerations for implementing controls based\n    on mission or business requirements, operational environments, or assessments of risk. The\n    additional information can also explain the purpose of controls and often includes examples.\n    Control enhancements may also include a separate discussion section when the discussion\n    information is applicable only to a specific control enhancement.\n    The related controls section provides a list of controls from the control catalog that impact or\n    support the implementation of a particular control or control enhancement, address a related\n    security or privacy capability, or are referenced in the discussion section. Control enhancements\n    are inherently related to their base control. Thus, related controls that are referenced in the\n    base control are not repeated in the control enhancements. However, there may be related\n    controls identified for control enhancements that are not referenced in the base control (i.e.,\n    the related control is only associated with the specific control enhancement). Controls may also\n    be related to enhancements of other base controls. When a control is designated as a related\n    control, a corresponding designation is made on that control in its source location in the catalog\n    to illustrate the two-way relationship. Additionally, each control in a given family is inherently\n    related to the -1 control (Policy and Procedures) in the same family. Therefore, the relationship\n    between the -1 control and the other controls in the same family is not specified in the related\n    controls section for each control.\n    The control enhancements section provides statements of security and privacy capability that\n    augment a base control. The control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each\n    control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the\n    base control. Each control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended function or\n    capability provided by the enhancement. In the AU-4 example, if the control enhancement is\n    selected, the control designation becomes AU-4(1). The numerical designation of a control\n    enhancement is used only to identify that enhancement within the control. The designation is\n    not indicative of the strength of the control enhancement, level of protection, priority, degree of\n    importance, or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements\n    are not intended to be selected independently. That is, if a control enhancement is selected,\n    then the corresponding base control is also selected and implemented.\n    The references section includes a list of applicable laws, policies, standards, guidelines, websites,\n    and other useful references that are relevant to a specific control or control enhancement.26 The\n    references section also includes hyperlinks to publications for obtaining additional information\n    for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring.\n    For some controls, additional flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific\n    values for designated parameters associated with the controls. Flexibility is achieved as part of a\n    tailoring process using assignment and selection operations embedded within the controls and\n    26 References are provided to assist organizations in understanding and implementing the security and privacy\n    controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.\n    enclosed by brackets. The assignment and selection operations give organizations the capability\n    to customize controls based on organizational security and privacy requirements. In contrast to\n  assignment operations which allow complete flexibility in the designation of parameter values,\n  selection operations narrow the range of potential values by providing a specific list of items\n  from which organizations choose.\n  Determination of the organization-defined parameters can evolve from many sources, including\n  laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and mission or\n  business needs. Organizational risk assessments and risk tolerance are also important factors in\n  determining the values for control parameters. Once specified by the organization, the values\n  for the assignment and selection operations become a part of the control. Organization-defined\n  control parameters used in the base controls also apply to the control enhancements associated\n  with those controls. The implementation of the control is assessed for effectiveness against the\n  completed control statement.\n  In addition to assignment and selection operations embedded in a control, additional flexibility\n  is achieved through iteration and refinement actions. Iteration allows organizations to use a\n  control multiple times with different assignment and selection values, perhaps being applied in\n  different situations or when implementing multiple policies. For example, an organization may\n  have multiple systems implementing a control but with different parameters established to\n  address different risks for each system and environment of operation. Refinement is the process\n  of providing additional implementation detail to a control. Refinement can also be used to\n  narrow the scope of a control in conjunction with iteration to cover all applicable scopes (e.g.,\n  applying different authentication mechanisms to different system interfaces). The combination\n  of assignment and selection operations and iteration and refinement actions when applied to\n  controls provides the needed flexibility to allow organizations to satisfy a broad base of security\n  and privacy requirements at the organization, mission and business process, and system levels\n  of implementation.\n    2.3   CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES\n    There are three approaches to implementing the controls in Chapter Three: (1) a common\n    (inheritable) control implementation approach, (2) a system-specific control implementation\n    approach, and (3) a hybrid control implementation approach. The control implementation\n    approaches define the scope of applicability for the control, the shared nature or inheritability\n    of the control, and the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and\n                SECURITY AS A DESIGN PROBLEM\n      “Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is….a system design problem. A\n      combination of hardware, software, communications, physical, personnel and administrative-\n      procedural safeguards is required for comprehensive security….software safeguards alone are\n      not sufficient.”\n    -- The Ware Report\n      Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1970\n    authorization. Each control implementation approach has a specific objective and focus that\n    helps organizations select the appropriate controls, implement the controls in an effective\n    manner, and satisfy security and privacy requirements. A specific control implementation\n    approach may achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across\n    multiple systems and environments of operation.27\n  Common controls are controls whose implementation results in a capability that is inheritable\n  by multiple systems or programs. A control is deemed inheritable when the system or program\n  receives protection from the implemented control, but the control is developed, implemented,\n  assessed, authorized, and monitored by an internal or external entity other than the entity\n  responsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by\n  common controls can be inherited from many sources, including mission or business lines,\n  organizations, enclaves, environments of operation, sites, or other systems or programs.\n  Implementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure.\n  Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems—including many\n  physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident\n  response controls—are inheritable and, therefore, are good candidates for common control\n  status. Common controls can also include technology-based controls, such as identification and\n  authentication controls, boundary protection controls, audit and accountability controls,  and\n  access controls. The cost of development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and\n  monitoring can be amortized across multiple systems, organizational elements, and programs\n  using the common control implementation approach.\n  Controls not implemented as common controls are implemented as system-specific or hybrid\n  controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of the system owner and the\n  authorizing official for a given system. Implementing system-specific controls can introduce risk\n  if the control implementations are not interoperable with common controls. Organizations can\n  implement a control as hybrid if one part of the control is common (inheritable) and the other\n  part is system-specific. For example, an organization may implement control CP-2 using a\n    predefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with\n  individual system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The\n    division of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by\n    organization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used\n    by the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities. When a control is\n    implemented as a hybrid control, the common control provider is responsible for ensuring the\n    implementation, assessment, and monitoring of the common part of the hybrid control, and the\n    system owner is responsible for ensuring the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of\n    the system-specific part of the hybrid control. Implementing controls as hybrid controls can\n    introduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the\n    common and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear.\n    The determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common,\n  hybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot\n    be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on the language of the\n    27 [SP 800-37] provides additional guidance on control implementation approaches (formerly referred to as control\n    designations) and how the different approaches are used in the Risk Management Framework.\n    control. Identifying the control implementation approach can result in significant savings to\n  organizations in implementation and assessment costs and a more consistent application of the\n  controls organization-wide. Typically, the identification of the control implementation approach\n  is straightforward. However, the implementation takes significant planning and coordination.\n    Planning for the implementation approach of a control (i.e., common, hybrid, or system-specific)\n    is best carried out early in the system development life cycle and coordinated with the entities\n    providing the control [SP 800-37]. Similarly, if a control is to be inheritable, coordination is\n    required with the inheriting entity to ensure that the control meets its needs. This is especially\n    important given the nature of control parameters. An inheriting entity cannot assume that\n  controls are the same and mitigate the appropriate risk to the system just because the control\n  identifiers (e.g., AC-1) are the same. It is essential to examine the control parameters (e.g.,\n    assignment or selection operations) when determining if a common control is adequate to\n  mitigate system-specific risks.\n    2.4   SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS\n    The selection and implementation of security and privacy controls reflect the objectives of\n    information security and privacy programs and how those programs manage their respective\n    risks. Depending on the circumstances, these objectives and risks can be independent or\n    overlapping. Federal information security programs are responsible for protecting information\n    and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or\n    destruction (i.e., unauthorized activity or system behavior) to provide confidentiality, integrity,\n    and availability. Those programs are also responsible for managing security risk and for ensuring\n  compliance with applicable security requirements. Federal privacy programs are responsible for\n  managing risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, storage,\n  maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as “processing”) of\n  PII and for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements.28 When a system\n    processes PII, the information security program and the privacy program have a shared\n    responsibility for managing the security risks for the PII in the system. Due to this overlap in\n    responsibilities, the controls that organizations select to manage these security risks will\n    generally be the same regardless of their designation as security or privacy controls in control\n    baselines or program or system plans.\n    There also may be circumstances in which the selection and/or implementation of the control or\n    control enhancement affects the ability of a program to achieve its objectives and manage its\n    respective risks. The control discussion section may highlight specific security and/or privacy\n    considerations so that organizations can take these considerations into account as they\n  determine the most effective method to implement the control. However, these considerations\n  are not exhaustive.\n  For example, an organization might select AU-3 (Content of Audit Records) to support\n    monitoring for unauthorized access to an information asset that does not include PII. Since the\n    28 Privacy programs may also choose to consider the risks to individuals that may arise from their interactions with\n    information systems, where the processing of personally identifiable information may be less impactful than the\n    effect that the system has on individuals’ behavior or activities. Such effects would constitute risks to individual\n    autonomy, and organizations may need to take steps to manage those risks in addition to information security and\n    privacy risks.\n    potential loss of confidentiality of the information asset does not affect privacy, security\n    objectives are the primary driver for the selection of the control. However, the implementation\n    of the control with respect to monitoring for unauthorized access could involve the processing\n    of PII which may result in privacy risks and affect privacy program objectives. The discussion\n    section in AU-3 includes privacy risk considerations so that organizations can take those\n    considerations into account as they determine the best way to implement the control.\n    Additionally, the control enhancement AU-3(3) (Limit Personally Identifiable Information\n    Elements) could be selected to support managing these privacy risks.\n    Due to permutations in the relationship between information security and privacy program\n    objectives and risk management, there is a need for close collaboration between programs to\n    select and implement the appropriate controls for information systems processing PII.\n    Organizations consider how to promote and institutionalize collaboration between the two\n    programs to ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met and risks are appropriately\n    managed.29\n    2.5   TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ASSURANCE\n    The trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part\n    of the risk management strategies developed by organizations.30 Trustworthiness, in this\n    context, means worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever requirements may be needed for a\n    component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or\n    other entity.31 Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability,\n    performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential\n    adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of\n    trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-\n    defined, and can be accurately assessed.\n    Two fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are functionality and\n    assurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions,\n    mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational\n    systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate.\n    Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly,\n    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security\n    and privacy requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate\n    and enforce established security and privacy policies.\n    In general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is\n    expected of it can be enhanced by techniques that simplify or narrow the analysis by, for\n    example, increasing the discipline applied to the system architecture, software design,\n    specifications, code style, and configuration management. Security and privacy controls address\n    functionality and assurance. Certain controls focus primarily on functionality while other\n    controls focus primarily on assurance. Some controls can support functionality and assurance.\n    29 Resources to support information security and privacy program collaboration are available at [SP 800-53 RES].\n    30 [SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on systems security engineering and the application of security design principles\n    to achieve trustworthy systems.\n    31 See [NEUM04].\n    Organizations can select assurance-related controls to define system development activities,\n  generate evidence about the functionality and behavior of the system, and trace the evidence to\n    the system elements that provide such functionality or exhibit such behavior. The evidence is\n    used to obtain a degree of confidence that the system satisfies the stated security and privacy\n    requirements while supporting the organization’s mission and business functions. Assurance-\n    related controls are identified in the control summary tables in Appendix C.\n              EVIDENCE OF CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION\n      During control selection and implementation, it is important for organizations to consider the\n      evidence (e.g., artifacts, documentation) that will be needed to support current and future\n      control assessments. Such assessments help determine whether the controls are implemented\n      correctly, operating as intended, and satisfying security and privacy policies—thus, providing\n      essential information for senior leaders to make informed risk-based decisions.",

    "  control multiple times with different assignment and selection values, perhaps being applied in",

    "    2.3   CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES",
    "    There are three approaches to implementing the controls in Chapter Three: (1) a common",
    "    (inheritable) control implementation approach, (2) a system-specific control implementation",
    "    approach, and (3) a hybrid control implementation approach. The control implementation",
    "    approaches define the scope of applicability for the control, the shared nature or inheritability",
    "    of the control, and the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and",
    "                SECURITY AS A DESIGN PROBLEM",
    "      “Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is….a system design problem. A",
    "      combination of hardware, software, communications, physical, personnel and administrative-",
    "      procedural safeguards is required for comprehensive security….software safeguards alone are",
    "      not sufficient.”",
    "    -- The Ware Report",
    "      Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1970",
    "    authorization. Each control implementation approach has a specific objective and focus that",
    "    helps organizations select the appropriate controls, implement the controls in an effective",
    "    manner, and satisfy security and privacy requirements. A specific control implementation",
    "    approach may achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across",
    "    multiple systems and environments of operation.27",
    "  Common controls are controls whose implementation results in a capability that is inheritable",
    "  by multiple systems or programs. A control is deemed inheritable when the system or program",
    "  receives protection from the implemented control, but the control is developed, implemented,",
    "  assessed, authorized, and monitored by an internal or external entity other than the entity",
    "  responsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by",
    "  common controls can be inherited from many sources, including mission or business lines,",
    "  organizations, enclaves, environments of operation, sites, or other systems or programs.",
    "  Implementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure.",
    "  Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems—including many",
    "  physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident",
    "  response controls—are inheritable and, therefore, are good candidates for common control",
    "  status. Common controls can also include technology-based controls, such as identification and",
    "  authentication controls, boundary protection controls, audit and accountability controls,  and",
    "  access controls. The cost of development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and",
    "  monitoring can be amortized across multiple systems, organizational elements, and programs",
    "  using the common control implementation approach.",
    "  Controls not implemented as common controls are implemented as system-specific or hybrid",
    "  controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of the system owner and the",
    "  authorizing official for a given system. Implementing system-specific controls can introduce risk",
    "  if the control implementations are not interoperable with common controls. Organizations can",
    "  implement a control as hybrid if one part of the control is common (inheritable) and the other",
    "  part is system-specific. For example, an organization may implement control CP-2 using a",
    "    predefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with",
    "  individual system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The",
    "    division of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by",
    "    organization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used",
    "    by the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities. When a control is",
    "    implemented as a hybrid control, the common control provider is responsible for ensuring the",
    "    implementation, assessment, and monitoring of the common part of the hybrid control, and the",
    "    system owner is responsible for ensuring the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of",
    "    the system-specific part of the hybrid control. Implementing controls as hybrid controls can",
    "    introduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the",
    "    common and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear.",
    "    The determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common,",
    "  hybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot",
    "    be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on the language of the",
    "    27 [SP 800-37] provides additional guidance on control implementation approaches (formerly referred to as control",
    "    designations) and how the different approaches are used in the Risk Management Framework.",
    "    control. Identifying the control implementation approach can result in significant savings to",
    "  organizations in implementation and assessment costs and a more consistent application of the",
    "  controls organization-wide. Typically, the identification of the control implementation approach",
    "  is straightforward. However, the implementation takes significant planning and coordination.",
    "    Planning for the implementation approach of a control (i.e., common, hybrid, or system-specific)",
    "    is best carried out early in the system development life cycle and coordinated with the entities",
    "    providing the control [SP 800-37]. Similarly, if a control is to be inheritable, coordination is",
    "    required with the inheriting entity to ensure that the control meets its needs. This is especially",
    "    important given the nature of control parameters. An inheriting entity cannot assume that",
    "  controls are the same and mitigate the appropriate risk to the system just because the control",
    "  identifiers (e.g., AC-1) are the same. It is essential to examine the control parameters (e.g.,",
    "    assignment or selection operations) when determining if a common control is adequate to",
    "  mitigate system-specific risks.",
    "    2.4   SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS",
    "    The selection and implementation of security and privacy controls reflect the objectives of",
    "    information security and privacy programs and how those programs manage their respective",
    "    risks. Depending on the circumstances, these objectives and risks can be independent or",
    "    overlapping. Federal information security programs are responsible for protecting information",
    "    and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or",
    "    destruction (i.e., unauthorized activity or system behavior) to provide confidentiality, integrity,",
    "    and availability. Those programs are also responsible for managing security risk and for ensuring",
    "  compliance with applicable security requirements. Federal privacy programs are responsible for",
    "  managing risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, storage,",
    "  maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as “processing”) of",
    "  PII and for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements.28 When a system",
    "    processes PII, the information security program and the privacy program have a shared",
    "    responsibility for managing the security risks for the PII in the system. Due to this overlap in",
    "    responsibilities, the controls that organizations select to manage these security risks will",
    "    generally be the same regardless of their designation as security or privacy controls in control",
    "    baselines or program or system plans.",
    "    There also may be circumstances in which the selection and/or implementation of the control or",
    "    control enhancement affects the ability of a program to achieve its objectives and manage its",
    "    respective risks. The control discussion section may highlight specific security and/or privacy",
    "    considerations so that organizations can take these considerations into account as they",
    "  determine the most effective method to implement the control. However, these considerations",
    "  are not exhaustive.",
    "  For example, an organization might select AU-3 (Content of Audit Records) to support",
    "    monitoring for unauthorized access to an information asset that does not include PII. Since the",
    "    28 Privacy programs may also choose to consider the risks to individuals that may arise from their interactions with",
    "    information systems, where the processing of personally identifiable information may be less impactful than the",
    "    effect that the system has on individuals’ behavior or activities. Such effects would constitute risks to individual",
    "    autonomy, and organizations may need to take steps to manage those risks in addition to information security and",
    "    privacy risks.",
    "    potential loss of confidentiality of the information asset does not affect privacy, security",
    "    objectives are the primary driver for the selection of the control. However, the implementation",
    "    of the control with respect to monitoring for unauthorized access could involve the processing",
    "    of PII which may result in privacy risks and affect privacy program objectives. The discussion",
    "    section in AU-3 includes privacy risk considerations so that organizations can take those",
    "    considerations into account as they determine the best way to implement the control.",
    "    Additionally, the control enhancement AU-3(3) (Limit Personally Identifiable Information",
    "    Elements) could be selected to support managing these privacy risks.",
    "    Due to permutations in the relationship between information security and privacy program",
    "    objectives and risk management, there is a need for close collaboration between programs to",
    "    select and implement the appropriate controls for information systems processing PII.",
    "    Organizations consider how to promote and institutionalize collaboration between the two",
    "    programs to ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met and risks are appropriately",
    "    managed.29",
    "    2.5   TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ASSURANCE",
    "    The trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part",
    "    of the risk management strategies developed by organizations.30 Trustworthiness, in this",
    "    context, means worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever requirements may be needed for a",
    "    component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or",
    "    other entity.31 Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability,",
    "    performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential",
    "    adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of",
    "    trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-",
    "    defined, and can be accurately assessed.",
    "    Two fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are functionality and",
    "    assurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions,",
    "    mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational",
    "    systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate.",
    "    Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly,",
    "    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security",
    "    and privacy requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate",
    "    and enforce established security and privacy policies.",
    "    In general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is",
