That assessment shall be established based on the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.\nIn determining the probability and severity of harm, the following criteria shall, where relevant, be taken into account:\n(a)\nthe nature of the hazard inherent to the function of the category of machinery or related product, taking into account the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n(b)\nthe severity of harm which a person would suffer, including the degree of reversibility of that harm;\n(c)\nthe number of persons potentially affected by the harm;\n(d)\nthe frequency and the duration of the exposure to the hazard that a person would be exposed to in the course of the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of the category of machinery or related product;\n(e)\nthe possibilities of avoiding or limiting harm;\n(f)\nin the case of safety components, the likelihood of serious consequences for the safety of the persons exposed to harm in the event of their failure.\n5.   When conducting the assessment referred in paragraph 4, the Commission shall consider the following elements:\n(a)\nindications of harm that have been caused in the past by machinery or related products which have been used for their intended use or following any reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n(b)\ninformation about safety defects detected in the course of market surveillance, and material possibly available in the information systems administered by the Commission;\n(c)\ninformation about known accidents and serious ‘close calls’, including the characteristics of those accidents or ‘close calls’;\n(d)\ndata on accidents or damage to health caused by the machinery or related product for at least the preceding four years. In particular, information obtained, inter alia, from the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS), safeguard clauses, Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, the European Injury Database (EU-IDB), Eurostat’s European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) and the Machinery Administrative Cooperation Group (AdCo).\nIn addition to points (a) to (d) of this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account any other information available that is relevant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4.\n6.   The data and information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d), shall be provided by Member States in accordance with paragraph 9.\n7.   A category of machinery or related product shall be included in Annex I, Part A, if, according to the assessment referred to in paragraph 4, and taking into account the available information, including the data referred to in paragraph 5, it presents a serious inherent potential risk, and one or more of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n(a)\nthere is a lack of harmonised standards or common specifications covering the relevant essential health and safety requirements;\n(b)\nresidual risks exist, including those which, according to the manufacturer, could be reduced by particular training or personal protective equipment, and the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, demonstrate the recurrence of similar serious or fatal accidents or damage to health in connection with those residual risks;\n(c)\ndata and information exist which according to the Commission demonstrate recurring wrongful application of the relevant harmonised standards or common specifications and for which the market surveillance activities that were carried out have not led to major improvements of the market situation, in a reasonable period;\n(d)\nthere is a degree of uncertainty in the existing risk assessment methods related to new categories of machinery or technologies.\nAny other category of machinery or related product that, according to that assessment, presents a serious inherent potential risk but does not fulfil one or more of the conditions in points (a) to (d) shall be included in Annex I, Part B.\n8.   A Member State which has concerns about a category of machinery or related product being listed or not in Annex I shall immediately inform the Commission of those concerns and provide reasons in support thereof.\nThe Commission shall conduct the assessment referred to in paragraph 4 immediately after being informed by a Member State.\nAfter making that assessment, the Commission may initiate the procedure laid down in paragraph 2.\n9.   By 14 July 2025, and every five years thereafter, Member States shall provide the data and information referred to in paragraph 5, including information to the effect that none of the events referred to in paragraph 5 has occurred, for every category of machinery or related products which is included in Annex I or which is not included in Annex I where that non-inclusion is a cause of concern for the Member State.\n10.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out and, where necessary in the light of technological and market development, updating a template concerning the collection by Member States of the data and the information referred to in paragraph 5, points (a) to (d).\nWhen adopting those implementing acts, the Commission shall issue guidance to Member States on the collection and transmission of comparable, high-quality data and information.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 48(3).\nThe first such implementing act shall be adopted not later than 14 July 2024.\n11.   If necessary after the Commission report referred to in Article 53(3), the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to supplement paragraph 5 of this Article by specifying the obligations of Member States to provide data and information required pursuant to this Article through the establishment of a common methodology concerning the data and information to be collected, including the methods for their collection and compilation, and the procedures for their transmission, as well as the relevant definitions, in order to ensure that sufficient and comparable data is available for the Commission to carry out the assessment referred to in paragraph 4.",

Where relevant, the source code or the programming logic included in the technical documentation shall, upon a reasoned request, be made available to the competent national authorities, if that source code or programming logic is necessary in order for them to be able to check compliance with the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex III.\n4.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place in order that machinery or related products that are part of a series production remain in conformity with this Regulation. Adequate account shall be taken of changes in the production process or in the design or characteristics of the machinery or related product, and changes in the harmonised standards, in other technical specifications, or in the common specifications referred to in Article 20 by reference to which the conformity of the machinery or related product is declared.\nWhen deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by machinery or related products, manufacturers shall, in order to protect the health and safety of users, carry out sample testing of machinery or related products made available on the market and investigate their results. If necessary, manufacturers shall keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming machinery or related products and machinery or related product recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related product which they place on the market or put into service bears at least a designation of the machinery or related product model, series or type, the year of construction, namely the year in which the manufacturing process was completed, and any batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification that exists, or, where the size or nature of the machinery or related product does not allow this, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the machinery or related product.\n6.   Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark, and the postal address and website, e-mail address or other digital contact at which they can be contacted, on the machinery or related product or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the machinery or related product. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities.\n7.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related products are accompanied by the instructions for use and the information set out in Annex III. The instructions may be provided in a digital format. Such instructions and information shall clearly describe the product model to which they correspond.\nWhen the instructions for use are provided in digital format, the manufacturer shall:\n(a)\nmark on the machinery or related product, or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in an accompanying document, how to access the digital instructions;\n(b)\npresent them in a format that makes it possible for the user to print and download the instructions for use and save them on an electronic device so that he or she can access them at all times, in particular during a breakdown of the machinery or related product; this requirement also applies where the instructions for use are embedded in the software of the machinery or related product;\n(c)\nmake them accessible online during the expected lifetime of the machinery or related product and for at least 10 years after the placing on the market of the machinery or related product.\nHowever, at the request of the user at the time of the purchase, the manufacturer shall provide the instructions for use in paper format free of charge within one month.\nIn the case of machinery or a related product intended for non-professional users or that can, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, be used by non-professional users, even if not intended for them, the manufacturer shall provide, in paper format, the safety information that is essential for putting the machinery or related product into service and for using it in a safe way.\nThe instructions for use, the safety information and the information set out in Annex III shall be in a language which can be easily understood by users, as determined by the Member State concerned, and shall be clear, understandable and legible.\n8.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the machinery or related product is accompanied by the EU declaration of conformity set out in Annex V, Part A or, alternatively, manufacturers shall provide the internet address or machine-readable code where that EU declaration of conformity can be accessed in the instructions for use and the information set out in Annex III.\nDigital EU declarations of conformity shall be made accessible online for the expected lifetime of the machinery or related product and in any event for at least 10 years after the placing on the market or the putting into service of the machinery or related product.\n9.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that machinery or a related product, which they have placed on the market or put into service is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective actions necessary to bring that machinery or related product into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. Furthermore, where the machinery or related product presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, and, where appropriate, domestic animals or to property, and, where applicable, to the environment, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the machinery or related product available on the market, or in which they put it into service, to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective actions taken.\n10.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation, in paper or digital format, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery or related products with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.

A\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘hazard’ means a potential source of injury or damage to health;\n(b)\n‘danger zone’ means any zone within and/or around machinery or a related product in which a person is subject to a risk to his or her health or safety;\n(c)\n‘exposed person’ means any person wholly or partially in a danger zone;\n(d)\n‘operator’ means the person or persons installing, operating, adjusting, maintaining, cleaning, repairing or moving machinery or a related product;\n(e)\n‘risk’ means a combination of the probability and the degree of an injury or damage to health that can arise in a hazardous situation;\n(f)\n‘guard’ means a part of machinery or a related product used specifically to provide protection by means of a physical barrier;\n(g)\n‘protective device’ means a device (other than a guard) which reduces the risk, either alone or in conjunction with a guard;\n(h)\n‘intended use’ means the use of machinery or a related product in accordance with the information provided in the instructions for use;\n(i)\n‘reasonably foreseeable misuse’ means the use of machinery or a related product in a way not intended in the instructions for use, but which may result from readily predictable human behaviour.\nPART B\nGeneral principles\n1.\nThe manufacturer of machinery or a related product shall ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the essential health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery or related product. The machinery or related product shall then be designed and constructed to eliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, to minimise all relevant risks, taking into account the results of the risk assessment.\nBy the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to in the first subparagraph, the manufacturer shall:\n(a)\ndetermine the limits of the machinery or related product, which include the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof;\n(b)\nidentify the hazards that may be generated by the machinery or related product and the associated hazardous situations;\n(c)\nestimate the risks, taking into account the severity of the possible injury or damage to health and the probability of its occurrence;\n(d)\nevaluate the risks, with a view to determining whether risk reduction is required, in accordance with the objective of this Regulation;\n(e)\neliminate the hazards or reduce the risks associated with these hazards by application of protective measures, in the order of priority established in section 1.1.2(b).\nThe risk assessment and risk reduction shall include hazards that might arise during the lifecycle of the machinery or related product that are foreseeable at the time of placing the machinery or related product on the market as an intended evolution of its fully or partially self-evolving behaviour or logic as a result of the machinery or related product designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy. The risk assessment and risk reduction shall include risks resulting from interactions between machinery in order to achieve the same end that are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole, thus forming machinery as defined in Article 3, point 1, point (d).\n2.\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements only apply when the corresponding hazard exists for the machinery or related product in question when it is used under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer or in foreseeable abnormal situations. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 and the obligations concerning marking of machinery or related products referred to in section 1.7.3, and instructions for use referred to in section 1.7.4 apply in all cases.\n3.\nThe essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Annex are mandatory; however, taking into account the state of the art, it may not be possible to meet the objectives set by them. In that event, the machinery or related product shall, as far as possible, be designed and constructed with the purpose of approaching those objectives.\n4.\nThis Annex is organised into six chapters. The first chapter is of general scope and applicable to all machinery or related products. The other chapters refer to certain sorts of more specific hazards. Nevertheless, it is essential to examine the whole of this Annex in order to be sure of meeting all the relevant essential health and safety requirements. When machinery or a related product is being designed, the requirements of the first chapter and the requirements of one or more of the other chapters shall be taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1 of these General Principles. Essential health and safety requirements for the protection of the environment are applicable only to the machinery or related products referred to in section 2.4.\n5.\nThese general principles shall apply to the risk assessment carried out by the manufacturer of partly completed machinery.\n1.   ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS\n1.1.    General remarks\n1.1.1.    Applicability\nThe obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements are applicable to partly completed machinery insofar as those requirements are relevant.\nThe relevant requirements in relation to partly completed machinery do not cover the requirements that can only be fulfilled at the time of the incorporation of the partly completed machinery. However, the principles of safety integration established in section 1.1.2 are applicable in all cases.\n1.1.2.    Principles of safety integration\n(a)\nMachinery or related products shall be designed and constructed so that they are fit for their function, and can be operated, adjusted and maintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under the conditions foreseen but also taking into account any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The aim of protective measures shall be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery or related product including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping.\n(b)\nIn selecting the most appropriate methods, the manufacturer shall apply the following principles, in the order given:\n(i)\neliminate hazards or, if that is not possible, minimise risks (inherently safe machinery or related product design and construction);\n(ii)\ntake the necessary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated;\n(iii)\ninform users of the residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protective measures adopted, indicate whether any particular training is required and specify any need to provide personal protective equipment.\n(c)\nWhen designing and constructing machinery or a related product and when drafting the instructions for use, the manufacturer shall envisage not only the intended use of the machinery or related product but also any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The machinery or related product shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal use if such use would engender a risk.
