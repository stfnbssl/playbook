The adoption of an \ninformation security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment \nand implementation of an organization’s information security management system is influenced by the \norganization’s needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the \nsize and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that \nrisks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganization’s processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis document can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organization's ability to meet \nthe organization’s own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this document does not reflect their importance \nor imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference \npurpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003[2], ISO/IEC 27004[3] and ISO/IEC 27005[4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis document applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, common terms, \nand core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO Supplement, \nand therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the \nAnnex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to \noperate a single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system \nstandards.\nv\n\n\n\nInformation security, cybersecurity and privacy \nprotection — Information security management systems \n— Requirements\n1\t Scope\nThis document specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually \nimproving an information security management system within the context of the organization. This \ndocument also includes requirements for the assessment and treatment of information security risks \ntailored to the needs of the organization. The requirements set out in this document are generic and are \nintended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or nature. Excluding any of the \nrequirements specified in Clauses 4 to 10 is not acceptable when an organization claims conformity to \nthis document.\n2\t Normative references\nThe following documents are referred to in the text in such a way that some or all of their content \nconstitutes requirements of this document.

    "0.1 General",
    "This document has been prepared to provide requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining ",
    "and continually improving an information security management system. The adoption of an ",
    "information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment ",
    "and implementation of an organization’s information security management system is influenced by the ",
    "organization’s needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the ",
    "size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.",
    "The information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability ",
    "of information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that ",
    "risks are adequately managed.",
    "It is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the ",
    "organization’s processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered ",
    "in the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security ",
    "management system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.",
    "This document can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organization's ability to meet ",
    "the organization’s own information security requirements.",
    "The order in which requirements are presented in this document does not reflect their importance ",
    "or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference ",
