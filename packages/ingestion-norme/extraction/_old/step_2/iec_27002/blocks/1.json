It is to be used as a reference for \ndetermining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information \nsecurity management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance \ndocument for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security \ncontrols. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-\nspecific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific \ninformation security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than \nthose included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.\nOrganizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) \ncreate, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic, \nphysical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).\nThe value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas \nand brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information \nand other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural, \naccidental or deliberate.\nInformation security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules, \nprocesses, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its \nspecific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review \nand improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a \nholistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and \nimplement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a \ncoherent management system.\nMany information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be \nsecure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that \ncan be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate \nmanagement activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place \nrequires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.\nA successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require \nparticipation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject \nmatter experts can also be needed.\nA suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the \norganization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated \nassets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the \norganization to achieve the stated business objectives.\n0.2 Information security requirements\nIt is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three \nmain sources of information security requirements:\na)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business \nstrategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-\nspecific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to \nensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;\nb)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its \ninterested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-\ncultural environment;\nvii\n\n\nc)\t\nthe set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of \ninformation that an organization has developed to support its operations.\n0.3 Controls\nA control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document \nare controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example, \ncan only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk. \nMoreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document \nprovides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security \ncontrols derived from internationally recognized best practices.\n0.4 Determining controls\nDetermining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with \na clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk \nacceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The \ndetermination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international \nlegislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls \ninteract with one another to provide defence in depth.\nThe organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such \ncontrols, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and \noperate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions \nregarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of \ncompeting requirements for resources.\nThere should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential \nresulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a \nrisk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for \nmanaging information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect \nagainst these risks.\nSome of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security \nmanagement and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining \ncontrols and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.\n0.5 Developing organization-specific guidelines\nThis document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines. \nNot all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional \ncontrols and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs \nof the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing \nadditional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document \nfor future reference.\n0.6 Life cycle considerations\nInformation has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary \nthroughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is \nnot significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information \nsecurity remains important to some extent at all stages.\nInformation systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which \nthey are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and \neventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every \nstage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to \nimprove security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from \nincidents.\nviii\n\t\n\n\n\n0.7 Related International Standards\nWhile this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are \ncommonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC 27000 family \nprovide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing \ninformation security.\nRefer to ISO/IEC 27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents. \nISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000 \nfamily of documents, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.\nThere are sector-specific standards that have additional controls which aim at addressing specific \nareas (e.g. ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud services, ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC 27019 for energy, \nISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are \nincluded in the Bibliography and some of them are referenced in the guidance and other information \nsections in Clauses 5-8.\nix\n\n\n\nInformation security, cybersecurity and privacy \nprotection — Information security controls\n1\t Scope\nThis document provides a reference set of generic information security controls including \nimplementation guidance. This document is designed to be used by organizations:\na)\t within the context of an information security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001;\nb)\t for implementing information security controls based on internationally recognized best practices;\nc)\t\nfor developing organization-specific information security management guidelines.\n2\t Normative references\nThere are no normative

    "Introduction",
    "0.1 Background and context",
    "This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It is to be used as a reference for ",
    "determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information ",
    "security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance ",
    "document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security ",
    "controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-",
    "specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific ",
    "information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than ",
    "those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.",
    "Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) ",
    "create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic, ",
    "physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).",
    "The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas ",
    "and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information ",
    "and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural, ",
    "accidental or deliberate.",
    "Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules, ",
    "processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its ",
    "specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review ",
    "and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a ",
    "holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and ",
    "implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a ",
    "coherent management system.",
    "Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be ",
    "secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that ",
    "can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate ",
    "management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place ",
    "requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.",
    "A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require ",
    "participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject ",
    "matter experts can also be needed.",
    "A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the ",
    "organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated ",
    "assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the ",
    "organization to achieve the stated business objectives.",
    "0.2 Information security requirements",
    "It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three ",
    "main sources of information security requirements:",
    "a)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business ",
    "strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-",
    "specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to ",
    "ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;",
    "b)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its ",
    "interested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-",
    "cultural environment;",
    "vii",
    "",
    "",
    "c)\t",
    "the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of ",
    "information that an organization has developed to support its operations.",
    "0.3 Controls",
    "A control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document ",
    "are controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example, ",
    "can only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk. ",
    "Moreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document ",
    "provides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security ",
    "controls derived from internationally recognized best practices.",
    "0.4 Determining controls",
    "Determining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with ",
    "a clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk ",
    "acceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The ",
    "determination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international ",
    "legislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls ",
    "interact with one another to provide defence in depth.",
    "The organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such ",
