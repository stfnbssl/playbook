Attributes can be used to filter, sort or \npresent controls in different views for different audiences. Annex A explains how this can be achieved \nand provides an example of a view.\nBy way of example, each control in this document has been associated with five attributes with \ncorresponding attribute values (preceded by \"#\" to make them searchable), as follows:\na)\t Control type\nControl type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of when and how the control \nmodifies the risk with regard to the occurrence of an information security incident. Attribute values \nconsist of Preventive (the control that is intended to prevent the occurrence of an information \nsecurity incident), Detective (the control acts when an information security incident occurs) and \nCorrective (the control acts after an information security incident occurs).\nb)\t Information security properties\nInformation security properties is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of which \ncharacteristic of information the control will contribute to preserving. Attribute values consist of \nConfidentiality, Integrity and Availability.\nc)\t\nCybersecurity concepts\nCybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of the association \nof controls to cybersecurity concepts defined in the cybersecurity framework described in \nISO/IEC TS 27110. Attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.\nd)\t Operational capabilities\nOperational capabilities is an attribute to view controls from the practitioner’s perspective of \ninformation security capabilities. Attribute values consist of Governance, Asset_management, \nInformation_protection, \nHuman_resource_security, \nPhysical_security, \nSystem_and_network_\nsecurity, \nApplication_security, \nSecure_configuration, \nIdentity_and_access_management, \nThreat_and_vulnerability_management, Continuity, Supplier_relationships_security, Legal_and_\ncompliance, Information_security_event_management and Information_security_assurance.\n\t\n\n\n\n8\n\ne)\t Security domains\nSecurity domains is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of four information security \ndomains: “Governance and Ecosystem” includes “Information System Security Governance & \nRisk Management” and “Ecosystem cybersecurity management” (including internal and external \nstakeholders); “Protection” includes “IT Security Architecture”, “IT Security Administration”, \n“Identity and access management”, “IT Security Maintenance” and “Physical and environmental \nsecurity”; “Defence” includes “Detection” and “Computer Security Incident Management”; \n“Resilience” includes “Continuity of operations” and “Crisis management”. Attribute values consist \nof Governance_and_Ecosystem, Protection, Defence and Resilience.\nThe attributes given in this document are selected because they are considered generic enough to be \nused by different types of organizations. Organizations can choose to disregard one or more of the \nattributes given in this document. They can also create attributes of their own (with the corresponding \nattribute values) to create their own organizational views. Clause A.2 includes examples of such \nattributes.\n4.3\t Control layout\nThe layout for each control contains the following:\n—\t Control title: Short name of the control;\n—\t Attribute table: A table shows the value(s) of each attribute for the given control;\n—\t Control: What the control is;\n—\t Purpose: Why the control should be implemented;\n—\t Guidance: How the control should be implemented;\n—\t Other information: Explanatory text or references to other related documents.\nSubheadings are used in the guidance text for some controls to aid readability where guidance is lengthy \nand addresses multiple topics. Such headings are not necessarily used in all guidance text. Subheadings \nare underlined.",
