It is to be used as a reference for \ndetermining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information \nsecurity management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance \ndocument for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security \ncontrols. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-\nspecific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific \ninformation security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than \nthose included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.\nOrganizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) \ncreate, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic, \nphysical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).\nThe value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas \nand brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information \nand other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural, \naccidental or deliberate.\nInformation security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules, \nprocesses, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its \nspecific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review \nand improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a \nholistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and \nimplement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a \ncoherent management system.\nMany information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be \nsecure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that \ncan be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate \nmanagement activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place \nrequires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.\nA successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require \nparticipation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject \nmatter experts can also be needed.\nA suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the \norganization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated \nassets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the \norganization to achieve the stated business objectives.\n0.2 Information security requirements\nIt is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three \nmain sources of information security requirements:\na)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business \nstrategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-\nspecific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to \nensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;\nb)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its \ninterested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-\ncultural environment;\nvii\n\n\nc)\t\nthe set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of \ninformation that an organization has developed to support its operations.\n0.3 Controls\nA control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document \nare controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example, \ncan only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk. \nMoreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document \nprovides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security \ncontrols derived from internationally recognized best practices.\n0.4 Determining controls\nDetermining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with \na clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk \nacceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The \ndetermination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international \nlegislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls \ninteract with one another to provide defence in depth.\nThe organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such \ncontrols, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and \noperate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions \nregarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of \ncompeting requirements for resources.\nThere should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential \nresulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a \nrisk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for \nmanaging information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect \nagainst these risks.\nSome of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security \nmanagement and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining \ncontrols and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.\n0.5 Developing organization-specific guidelines\nThis document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines. \nNot all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional \ncontrols and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs \nof the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing \nadditional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document \nfor future reference.\n0.6 Life cycle considerations\nInformation has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary \nthroughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is \nnot significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information \nsecurity remains important to some extent at all stages.\nInformation systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which \nthey are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and \neventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every \nstage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to \nimprove security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from \nincidents.\nviii\n\t\n\n\n\n0.7 Related International Standards\nWhile this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are \ncommonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC 27000 family \nprovide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing \ninformation security.\nRefer to ISO/IEC 27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents. \nISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000 \nfamily of documents, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.\nThere are sector-specific standards that have additional controls which aim at addressing specific \nareas (e.g. ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud services, ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC 27019 for energy, \nISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are \nincluded in the Bibliography and some of them are referenced in the guidance and other information \nsections in Clauses 5-8.\nix\n\n\n\nInformation security, cybersecurity and privacy \nprotection — Information security controls\n1\t Scope\nThis document provides a reference set of generic information security controls including \nimplementation guidance. This document is designed to be used by organizations:\na)\t within the context of an information security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001;\nb)\t for implementing information security controls based on internationally recognized best practices;\nc)\t\nfor developing organization-specific information security management guidelines.\n2\t Normative references\nThere are no normative

(Clause 5)\nb)\t People controls (Clause 6)\nc)\t\nPhysical controls (Clause 7)\nd)\t Technological controls (Clause 8)\nThere are 2 informative annexes:\n—\t Annex A — Using attributes\t\n\n\n7\n\n—\t Annex B — Correspondence with ISO/IEC 27002:2013\nAnnex A explains how an organization can use attributes (see 4.2) to create its own views based on the \ncontrol attributes defined in this document or of its own creation.\nAnnex B shows the correspondence between the controls in this edition of ISO/IEC 27002 and the \nprevious 2013 edition.\n4.2\t Themes and attributes\nThe categorization of controls given in Clauses 5 to 8 are referred to as themes.\nControls are categorized as:\na)\t people, if they concern individual people;\nb)\t physical, if they concern physical objects;\nc)\t\ntechnological, if they concern technology;\nd)\t otherwise they are categorized as organizational.\nThe organization can use attributes to create different views which are different categorizations of \ncontrols as seen from a different perspective to the themes. Attributes can be used to filter, sort or \npresent controls in different views for different audiences. Annex A explains how this can be achieved \nand provides an example of a view.\nBy way of example, each control in this document has been associated with five attributes with \ncorresponding attribute values (preceded by \"#\" to make them searchable), as follows:\na)\t Control type\nControl type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of when and how the control \nmodifies the risk with regard to the occurrence of an information security incident. Attribute values \nconsist of Preventive (the control that is intended to prevent the occurrence of an information \nsecurity incident), Detective (the control acts when an information security incident occurs) and \nCorrective (the control acts after an information security incident occurs).\nb)\t Information security properties\nInformation security properties is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of which \ncharacteristic of information the control will contribute to preserving. Attribute values consist of \nConfidentiality, Integrity and Availability.\nc)\t\nCybersecurity concepts\nCybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of the association \nof controls to cybersecurity concepts defined in the cybersecurity framework described in \nISO/IEC TS 27110. Attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.\nd)\t Operational capabilities\nOperational capabilities is an attribute to view controls from the practitioner’s perspective of \ninformation security capabilities. Attribute values consist of Governance, Asset_management, \nInformation_protection, \nHuman_resource_security, \nPhysical_security, \nSystem_and_network_\nsecurity, \nApplication_security, \nSecure_configuration, \nIdentity_and_access_management, \nThreat_and_vulnerability_management, Continuity, Supplier_relationships_security, Legal_and_\ncompliance, Information_security_event_management and Information_security_assurance.\n\t\n\n\n\n8\n\ne)\t Security domains\nSecurity domains is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of four information security \ndomains: “Governance and Ecosystem” includes “Information System Security Governance & \nRisk Management” and “Ecosystem cybersecurity management” (including internal and external \nstakeholders); “Protection” includes “IT Security Architecture”, “IT Security Administration”, \n“Identity and access management”, “IT Security Maintenance” and “Physical and environmental \nsecurity”; “Defence” includes “Detection” and “Computer Security Incident Management”; \n“Resilience” includes “Continuity of operations” and “Crisis management”. Attribute values consist \nof Governance_and_Ecosystem, Protection, Defence and Resilience.\nThe attributes given in this document are selected because they are considered generic enough to be \nused by different types of organizations. Organizations can choose to disregard one or more of the \nattributes given in this document. They can also create attributes of their own (with the corresponding \nattribute values) to create their own organizational views. Clause A.2 includes examples of such \nattributes.\n4.3\t Control layout\nThe layout for each control contains the following:\n—\t Control title: Short name of the control;\n—\t Attribute table: A table shows the value(s) of each attribute for the given control;\n—\t Control: What the control is;\n—\t Purpose: Why the control should be implemented;\n—\t Guidance: How the control should be implemented;\n—\t Other information: Explanatory text or references to other related documents.\nSubheadings are used in the guidance text for some controls to aid readability where guidance is lengthy \nand addresses multiple topics. Such headings are not necessarily used in all guidance text. Subheadings \nare underlined.\n5\t Organizational controls\n5.1\t Policies for information security\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Governance\n#Governance_and_Eco\nsystem #Resilience\nControl\nInformation security policy and topic-specific policies should be defined, approved by management, \npublished, communicated to and acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties, \nand reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.\nPurpose\nTo ensure continuing suitability, adequacy, effectiveness of management direction and support \nfor information security in accordance with business, legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual \nrequirements.\n\n\n9\n\nGuidance\nAt the highest level, the organization should define an “information security policy” which is approved \nby top management and which sets out the organization’s approach to managing its information \nsecurity.\nThe information security policy should take into consideration requirements derived from:\na)\t business strategy and requirements;\nb)\t regulations, legislation and contracts;\nc)\t\nthe current and projected information security risks and threats.\nThe information security policy should contain statements concerning:\na)\t definition of information security;\nb)\t information security objectives or the framework for setting information security objectives;\nc)\t\nprinciples to guide all activities relating to information security;\nd)\t commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information security;\ne)\t commitment to continual improvement of the information security management system;\nf)\t\nassignment of responsibilities for information security management to defined roles;\ng)\t procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions.\nTop management should approve any changes to the information security policy.\nAt a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies as \nneeded, to further mandate the implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific policies \nare typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to \ncover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the \ninformation security policy of the organization.\nExamples of such topics include:\na)\t access control;\nb)\t physical and environmental security;\nc)\t\nasset management;\nd)\t information transfer;\ne)\t secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;\nf)\t\nnetworking security;\ng)\t information security incident management;\nh)\t backup;\ni)\t\ncryptography and key management;\nj)\t\ninformation classification and handling;\nk)\t management of technical vulnerabilities;\nl)\t\nsecure development.\n\t\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe responsibility for the development, review and approval of the topic-specific policies should be \nallocated to relevant personnel based on their appropriate level of authority and technical competency. \nThe review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information \nsecurity policy and topic-specific policies and managing information security in response to changes \nto:\na)\t the organization’s business strategy;\nb)\t the organization’s technical environment;\nc)\t\nregulations, statutes, legislation and contracts;\nd)\t information security risks;\ne)\t the current and projected information security threat environment;\nf)\t\nlessons learned from information security events and incidents.\nThe review of information security policy and topic-specific policies should take the results of \nmanagement reviews and audits into account. Review and update of other related policies should be \nconsidered when one policy is changed to maintain consistency.\nThe information security policy and topic-specific policies should be communicated to relevant \npersonnel and interested parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the \nintended reader. Recipients of the policies should be required to acknowledge they understand and \nagree to comply with the policies where applicable. The organization can determine the formats \nand names of these policy documents that meet the organization’s needs. In some organizations, the \ninformation security policy and topic-specific policies can be in a single document. The organization \ncan name these topic-specific policies as standards, directives, policies or others.\nIf the information security policy or any topic-specific policy is distributed outside the organization, \ncare should be taken not to improperly disclose confidential information.\nTable 1 illustrates the differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy.\nTable 1 — Differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy\n \nInformation security policy\nTopic-specific policy\nLevel of detail\nGeneral or high-level\nSpecific and detailed\nDocumented and formally \napproved by\nTop management\nAppropriate level of management\nOther information\nTopic-specific policies can vary across organizations.\n5.2\t Information security roles and responsibilities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Governance\n#Governance_and_Ecosys\ntem #Protection #Resilience\nControl\nInformation security roles and responsibilities should be defined and allocated according to the \norganization needs.\n\n\n11\n\nPurpose\nTo establish a defined, approved and understood structure for the implementation, operation and \nmanagement of information security within the organization.\nGuidance\nAllocation of information security roles and responsibilities should be done in accordance with the \ninformation security policy and topic-specific policies (see 5.1). The organization should define and \nmanage responsibilities for:\na)\t protection of information and other associated assets;\nb)\t carrying out specific information security processes;\nc)\t\ninformation security risk management activities and in particular acceptance of residual risks (e.g. \nto risk owners);\nd)\t all personnel using an organization’s information and other associated assets.\nThese responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for \nspecific sites and information processing facilities. Individuals with allocated information security \nresponsibilities can assign security tasks to others. However, they remain accountable and should \ndetermine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.\nEach security area for which individuals are responsible should be defined, documented and \ncommunicated. Authorization levels should be defined and documented. Individuals who take on a \nspecific information security role should be competent in the knowledge and skills required by the role \nand should be supported to keep up to date with developments related to the role and required in order \nto fulfil the responsibilities of the role.\nOther information\nMany organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall responsibility for the \ndevelopment and implementation of information security and to support the identification of risks and \nmitigating controls.\nHowever, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls often remains with individual \nmanagers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible \nfor its day-to-day protection.\nDepending on the size and resourcing of an organization, information security can be covered by \ndedicated roles or duties carried out in addition to existing roles.\n5.3\t Segregation of duties\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Governance\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Governance_and_Ecosys\ntem\nControl\nConflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility should be segregated.\nPurpose\nTo reduce the risk of fraud, error and bypassing of information security controls.\n\t\n\n\n\n12\n\nGuidance\nSegregation of duties and areas of responsibility aims to separate conflicting duties between different \nindividuals in order to prevent one individual from executing potential conflicting duties on their own.\nThe organization should determine which duties and areas of responsibility need to be segregated. The \nfollowing are examples of activities that can require segregation:\na)\t initiating, approving and executing a change;\nb)\t requesting, approving and implementing access rights;\nc)\t\ndesigning, implementing and reviewing code;\nd)\t developing software and administering production systems;\ne)\t using and administering applications;\nf)\t\nusing applications and administering databases;\ng)\t designing, auditing and assuring information security controls.\nThe possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the segregation controls. Small \norganizations can find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied \nas far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls should be \nconsidered, such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision.\nCare should be taken when using role-based access control systems to ensure that persons are not \ngranted conflicting roles. When there is a large number of roles, the organization should consider using \nautomated tools to identify conflicts and facilitate their removal. Roles should be carefully defined and \nprovisioned to minimize access problems if a role is removed or reassigned.\nOther information\nNo other information.\n5.4\t Management responsibilities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Governance\n#Governance_and_Ecosys\ntem\nControl\nManagement should require all personnel to apply information security in accordance with the \nestablished information security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures of the organization.\nPurpose\nTo ensure management understand their role in information security and undertake actions aiming to \nensure all personnel are aware of and fulfil their information security responsibilities.\nGuidance\nManagement should demonstrate support of the information security policy, topic-specific policies, \nprocedures and information security controls.\nManagement responsibilities should include ensuring that personnel:\na)\t are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted \naccess to the organization’s information and other associated assets;\n\n\n13\n\nb)\t are provided with guidelines which state the information security expectations of their role within \nthe organization;\nc)\t\nare mandated to fulfil the information security policy and topic-specific policies of the organization;\nd)\t achieve a level of awareness of information security relevant to their roles and responsibilities \nwithin the organization (see 6.3);\ne)\t compliance with the terms and conditions of employment, contract or agreement, including the \norganization’s information security policy and appropriate methods of working;\nf)\t\ncontinue to have the appropriate information security skills and qualifications through ongoing \nprofessional education;\ng)\t where practicable, are provided with a confidential channel for reporting violations of information \nsecurity policy, topic-specific policies or procedures for information security (“whistleblowing”). \nThis can allow for anonymous reporting, or have provisions to ensure that knowledge of the \nidentity of the reporter is known only to those who need to deal with such reports;\nh)\t are provided with adequate resources and project planning time for implementing the organization’s \nsecurity-related processes and controls.\nOther information\nNo other information.\n5.5\t Contact with authorities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive \n#Corrective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify #Protect\n#Respond #Recover\n#Governance\n#Defence\n#Resilience\nControl\nThe organization should establish and maintain contact with relevant authorities.\nPurpose\nTo ensure appropriate flow of information takes place with respect to information security between \nthe organization and relevant legal, regulatory and supervisory authorities.\nGuidance\nThe organization should specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, regulatory \nbodies, supervisory authorities) should be contacted and how identified information security incidents \nshould be reported in a timely manner.\nContacts with authorities should also be used to facilitate the understanding about the current and \nupcoming expectations of these authorities (e.g. applicable information security regulations).\nOther information\nOrganizations under attack can request authorities to take action against the attack source.\nMaintaining such contacts can be a requirement to support information security incident management \n(see 5.24 to 5.28) or the contingency planning and business continuity processes (see 5.29 and 5.30). \nContacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in \nrelevant laws or regulations that affect the organization. Contacts with other authorities include \nutilities, emergency services, electricity suppliers and health and safety [e.g. fire departments (in \n\t\n\n\n\n14\n\nconnection with business continuity), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing \nand availability) and water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment)].\n5.6\t Contact with special interest groups\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Corrective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect #Respond\n#Recover\n#Governance\n#Defence\nControl\nThe organization should establish and maintain contact with special interest groups or other specialist \nsecurity forums and professional associations.\nPurpose\nTo ensure appropriate flow of information takes place with respect to information security.\nGuidance\nMembership of special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to:\na)\t improve knowledge about best practices and stay up to date with relevant security information;\nb)\t ensure the understanding of the information security environment is current;\nc)\t\nreceive early warnings of alerts, advisories and patches pertaining to attacks and vulnerabilities;\nd)\t gain access to specialist information security advice;\ne)\t share and exchange information about new technologies, products, services, threats or \nvulnerabilities;\nf)\t\nprovide suitable liaison points when dealing with information security incidents (see 5.24 to 5.28).\nOther information\nNo other information.\n5.7\t Threat intelligence\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n#Corrective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify #Detect\n#Respond\n#Threat_and_vulner\nability_management\n#Defence\n#Resilience\nControl\nInformation relating to information security threats should be collected and analysed to produce threat \nintelligence.\nPurpose\nTo provide awareness of the organization’s threat environment so that the appropriate mitigation \nactions can be taken.\n\n\n15\n\nGuidance\nInformation about existing or emerging threats is collected and analysed in order to:\na)\t facilitate informed actions to prevent the threats from causing harm to the organization;\nb)\t reduce the impact of such threats.\nThreat intelligence can be divided into three layers, which should all be considered:\na)\t strategic threat intelligence: exchange of high-level information about the changing threat \nlandscape (e.g. types of attackers or types of attacks);\nb)\t tactical threat intelligence: information about attacker methodologies, tools and technologies \ninvolved;\nc)\t\noperational threat intelligence: details about specific attacks, including technical indicators.\nThreat intelligence should be:\na)\t relevant (i.e. related to the protection of the organization);\nb)\t insightful (i.e. providing the organization with an accurate and detailed understanding of the \nthreat landscape);\nc)\t\ncontextual, to provide situational awareness (i.e. adding context to the information based on the \ntime of events, where they occur, previous experiences and prevalence in similar organizations);\nd)\t actionable (i.e. the organization can act on information quickly and effectively).\nThreat intelligence activities should include:\na)\t establishing objectives for threat intelligence production;\nb)\t identifying, vetting and selecting internal and external information sources that are necessary and \nappropriate to provide information required for the production of threat intelligence;\nc)\t\ncollecting information from selected sources, which can be internal and external;\nd)\t processing information collected to prepare it for analysis (e.g. by translating, formatting or \ncorroborating information);\ne)\t analysing information to understand how it relates and is meaningful to the organization;\nf)\t\ncommunicating and sharing it to relevant individuals in a format that can be understood.\nThreat intelligence should be analysed and later used:\na)\t by implementing processes to include information gathered from threat intelligence sources into \nthe organization’s information security risk management processes;\nb)\t as additional input to technical preventive and detective controls like firewalls, intrusion detection \nsystem, or anti malware solutions;\nc)\t\nas input to the information security test processes and techniques.\nThe organization should share threat intelligence with other organizations on a mutual basis in order \nto improve overall threat intelligence.\nOther information\nOrganizations can use threat intelligence to prevent, detect, or respond to threats. Organizations can \nproduce threat intelligence, but more typically receive and make use of threat intelligence produced by \nother sources.\n\t\n\n\n\n16\n\nThreat intelligence is often provided by independent providers or advisors, government agencies or \ncollaborative threat intelligence groups.\nThe effectiveness of controls such as 5.25, 8.7, 8.16 or 8.23, depends on the quality of available threat \nintelligence.\n5.8\t Information security in project management\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify #Protect\n#Governance\n#Governance_and_Ecosys\ntem #Protection\nControl\nInformation security should be integrated into project management.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information security risks related to projects and deliverables are effectively addressed in \nproject management throughout the project life cycle.\nGuidance\nInformation security should be integrated into project management to ensure information security risks \nare addressed as part of the project management. This can be applied to any type of project regardless \nof its complexity, size, duration, discipline or application area (e.g. a project for a core business process, \nICT, facility management or other supporting processes).\nThe project management in use should require that:\na)\t information security risks are assessed and treated at an early stage and periodically as part of \nproject risks throughout the project life cycle;\nb)\t information security requirements [e.g. application security requirements (8.26), requirements \nfor complying with intellectual property rights (5.32), etc.] are addressed in the early stages of \nprojects;\nc)\t\ninformation security risks associated with the execution of projects, such as security of internal \nand external communication aspects are considered and treated throughout the project life cycle;\nd)\t progress on information security risk treatment is reviewed and effectiveness of the treatment is \nevaluated and tested.\nThe appropriateness of the information security considerations and activities should be followed up at \npredefined stages by suitable persons or governance bodies, such as the project steering committee.\nResponsibilities and authorities for information security relevant to the project should be defined and \nallocated to specified roles.\nInformation security requirements for products or services to be delivered by the project should be \ndetermined using various methods, including deriving compliance requirements from information \nsecurity policy, topic-specific policies and regulations. Further information security requirements can \nbe derived from activities such as threat modelling, incident reviews, use of vulnerability thresholds \nor contingency planning, thus ensuring that the architecture and design of information systems are \nprotected against known threats based on the operational environment.\nInformation security requirements should be determined for all types of projects, not only ICT \ndevelopment projects. The following should also be considered when determining these requirements:\n\n\n17\n\na)\t what information is involved (information determination), what are the corresponding information \nsecurity needs (classification; see 5.12) and the potential negative business impact which can result \nfrom lack of adequate security;\nb)\t the required protection needs of information and other associated assets involved, particularly in \nterms of confidentiality, integrity and availability;\nc)\t\nthe level of confidence or assurance required towards the claimed identity of entities in order to \nderive the authentication requirements;\nd)\t access provisioning and authorization processes, for customers and other potential business users \nas well as for privileged or technical users such as relevant project members, potential operation \nstaff or external suppliers;\ne)\t informing users of their duties and responsibilities;\nf)\t\nrequirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging and monitoring, non-\nrepudiation requirements;\ng)\t requirements mandated by other information security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and \nmonitoring or data leakage detection systems);\nh)\t compliance with the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual environment in which the \norganization operates;\ni)\t\nlevel of confidence or assurance required for third parties to meet the organization’s information \nsecurity policy and topic-specific policies including relevant security clauses in any agreements or \ncontracts.\nOther information\nThe project development approach, such as waterfall life cycle or agile life cycle, should support \ninformation security in a structured way that can be adapted to suit the assessed severity of the \ninformation security risks, based on the character of the project. Early consideration of information \nsecurity requirements for the product or service (e.g. at the planning and design stages), can lead \nto more effective and cost-efficient solutions for quality and information security. ISO 21500 and \nISO 21502 provide guidance on concepts and processes of project management that are important for \nthe performance of projects.\nISO/IEC 27005 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify controls to meet \ninformation security requirements.\n5.9\t Inventory of information and other associated assets\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Asset_manage\nment\n#Governance_and_Eco\nsystem #Protection\nControl\nAn inventory of information and other associated assets, including owners, should be developed and \nmaintained.\nPurpose\nTo identify the organization’s information and other associated assets in order to preserve their \ninformation security and assign appropriate ownership.\n\t\n\n\n\n18\n\nGuidance\nInventory\nThe organization should identify its information and other associated assets and determine their \nimportance in terms of information security. Documentation should be maintained in dedicated or \nexisting inventories as appropriate.\nThe inventory of information and other associated assets should be accurate, up to date, consistent and \naligned with other inventories. Options for ensuring accuracy of an inventory of information and other \nassociated assets include:\na)\t conducting regular reviews of identified information and other associated assets against the asset \ninventory;\nb)\t automatically enforcing an inventory update in the process of installing, changing or removing an \nasset.\nThe location of an asset should be included in the inventory as appropriate.\nThe inventory does not need to be a single list of information and other associated assets. Considering \nthat the inventory should be maintained by the relevant functions, it can be seen as a set of dynamic \ninventories, such as inventories for information assets, hardware, software, virtual machines (VMs), \nfacilities, personnel, competence, capabilities and records.\nEach asset should be classified in accordance with the classification of the information (see 5.12) \nassociated to that asset.\nThe granularity of the inventory of information and other associated assets should be at a level \nappropriate for the needs of the organization. Sometimes specific instances of assets in the information \nlife cycle are not feasible to be documented due to the nature of the asset. An example of a short-lived \nasset is a VM instance whose life cycle can be of short duration.\nOwnership\nFor the identified information and other associated assets, ownership of the asset should be assigned \nto an individual or a group and the classification should be identified (see 5.12, 5.13). A process to \nensure timely assignment of asset ownership should be implemented. Ownership should be assigned \nwhen assets are created or when assets are transferred to the organization. Asset ownership should be \nreassigned as necessary when current asset owners leave or change job roles.\nOwner duties\nThe asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset life \ncycle, ensuring that:\na)\t information and other associated assets are inventoried;\nb)\t information and other associated assets are appropriately classified and protected;\nc)\t\nthe classification is reviewed periodically;\nd)\t components supporting technology assets are listed and linked, such as database, storage, software \ncomponents and sub-components;\ne)\t requirements for the acceptable use of information and other associated assets (see 5.10) are \nestablished;\nf)\t\naccess restrictions correspond with the classification and that they are effective and are reviewed \nperiodically;\ng)\t information and other associated assets, when deleted or disposed, are handled in a secure manner \nand removed from the inventory;\n\n\n19\n\nh)\t they are involved in the identification and management of risks associated with their asset(s);\ni)\t\nthey support personnel who have the roles and responsibilities of managing their information.\nOther information\nInventories of information and other associated assets are often necessary to ensure the effective \nprotection of information and can be required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance \nor financial reasons. Inventories of information and other associated assets also support risk \nmanagement, audit activities, vulnerability management, incident response and recovery planning.\nTasks and responsibilities can be delegated (e.g. to a custodian looking after the assets on a daily basis), \nbut the person or group who delegated them remains accountable.\nIt can be useful to designate groups of information and other associated assets which act together to \nprovide a particular service. In this case, the owner of this service is accountable for the delivery of the \nservice, including the operation of its assets.\nSee ISO/IEC 19770-1 for additional information on information technology (IT) asset management.

They should be responsible for \ntheir use of any information processing facilities.\nThe organization should establish a topic-specific policy on the acceptable use of information and other \nassociated assets and communicate it to anyone who uses or handles information and other associated \nassets. The topic-specific policy on acceptable use should provide clear direction on how individuals \nare expected to use information and other associated assets. The topic-specific policy should state:\na)\t expected and unacceptable behaviours of individuals from an information security perspective;\nb)\t permitted and prohibited use of information and other associated assets;\nc)\t\nmonitoring activities being performed by the organization.\nAcceptable use procedures should be drawn up for the full information life cycle in accordance with its \nclassification (see 5.12) and determined risks. The following items should be considered:\na)\t access restrictions supporting the protection requirements for each level of classification;\nb)\t maintenance of a record of the authorized users of information and other associated assets;\n\t\n\n\n\n20\n\nc)\t\nprotection of temporary or permanent copies of information to a level consistent with the \nprotection of the original information;\nd)\t storage of assets associated with information in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications \n(see 7.8);\ne)\t clear marking of all copies of storage media (electronic or physical) for the attention of the \nauthorized recipient (see 7.10);\nf)\t\nauthorization of disposal of information and other associated assets and supported deletion \nmethod(s) (see 8.10).\nOther information\nIt can be the case that the assets concerned do not directly belong to the organization, such as public \ncloud services. The use of such third-party assets and any assets of the organization associated with \nsuch external assets (e.g. information, software) should be identified as applicable and controlled, \nfor example, through agreements with cloud service providers. Care should also be taken when a \ncollaborative working environment is used.\n5.11\tReturn of assets\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Asset_manage\nment\n#Protection\nControl\nPersonnel and other interested parties as appropriate should return all the organization’s assets in \ntheir possession upon change or termination of their employment, contract or agreement.\nPurpose\nTo protect the organization’s assets as part of the process of changing or terminating employment, \ncontract or agreement.\nGuidance\nThe change or termination process should be formalized to include the return of all previously issued \nphysical and electronic assets owned by or entrusted to the organization.\nIn cases where personnel and other interested parties purchase the organization’s equipment or use \ntheir own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information is \ntraced and transferred to the organization and securely deleted from the equipment (see 7.14).\nIn cases where personnel and other interested parties have knowledge that is important to ongoing \noperations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization.\nDuring the notice period and thereafter, the organization should prevent unauthorized copying of \nrelevant information (e.g. intellectual property) by personnel under notice of termination.\nThe organization should clearly identify and document all information and other associated assets to \nbe returned which can include:\na)\t user endpoint devices;\nb)\t portable storage devices;\nc)\t\nspecialist equipment;\n\n\n21\n\nd)\t authentication hardware (e.g. mechanical keys, physical tokens and smartcards) for information \nsystems, sites and physical archives;\ne)\t physical copies of information.\nOther information\nIt can be difficult to return information held on assets which are not owned by the organization. In such \ncases, it is necessary to restrict the use of information using other information security controls such \nas access rights management (5.18) or use of cryptography (8.24).\n5.12 Classification of information\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Information_pro\ntection\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nInformation should be classified according to the information security needs of the organization based \non confidentiality, integrity, availability and relevant interested party requirements.\nPurpose\nTo ensure identification and understanding of protection needs of information in accordance with its \nimportance to the organization.\nGuidance\nThe organization should establish a topic-specific policy on information classification and communicate \nit to all relevant interested parties.\nThe organization should take into account requirements for confidentiality, integrity and availability in \nthe classification scheme.\nClassifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business \nneeds for sharing or restricting information, for protecting integrity of information and for assuring \navailability, as well as legal requirements concerning the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the \ninformation. Assets other than information can also be classified in compliance with classification of \ninformation, which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset.\nOwners of information should be accountable for their classification.\nThe classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the \nclassification over time. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of the \nvalue, sensitivity and criticality of information through their life cycle.\nThe scheme should be aligned to the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.1) and should be able \nto address specific business needs of the organization.\nThe classification can be determined by the level of impact that the information's compromise would \nhave for the organization. Each level defined in the scheme should be given a name that makes sense in \nthe context of the classification scheme’s application.\nThe scheme should be consistent across the whole organization and included in its procedures so that \neveryone classifies information and applicable other associated assets in the same way. In this manner, \neveryone has a common understanding of protection requirements and applies appropriate protection.\nThe classification scheme used within the organization can be different from the schemes used by \nother organizations, even if the names for levels are similar. In addition, information moving between \n\t\n\n\n\n22\n\norganizations can vary in classification depending on its context in each organization, even if their \nclassification schemes are identical. Therefore, agreements with other organizations that include \ninformation sharing should include procedures to identify the classification of that information and to \ninterpret the classification levels from other organizations. Correspondence between different schemes \ncan be determined by looking for equivalence in the associated handling and protection methods.\nOther information\nClassification provides people who deal with information with a concise indication of how to handle \nand protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information \nsecurity procedures that apply to all the information in each group facilitates this. This approach \nreduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls.\nInformation can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time. For example, when the \ninformation has been made public, it no longer has confidentiality requirements but can still require \nprotection for its integrity and availability properties. These aspects should be taken into account, \nas over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional \nexpense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead to insufficient controls to protect the \ninformation from compromise.\nAs an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme can be based on four levels as \nfollows:\na)\t disclosure causes no harm;\nb)\t disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational impact;\nc)\t\ndisclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or business objectives;\nd)\t disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or puts the survival of the \norganization at risk.\n5.13\tLabelling of information\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Information_\nprotection\n#Defence\n#Protection\nControl\nAn appropriate set of procedures for information labelling should be developed and implemented in \naccordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization.\nPurpose\nTo facilitate the communication of classification of information and support automation of information \nprocessing and management.\nGuidance\nProcedures for information labelling should cover information and other associated assets in all \nformats. The labelling should reflect the classification scheme established in 5.12. The labels should \nbe easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance on where and how labels are attached in \nconsideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the types of \nstorage media. The procedures can define:\na)\t cases where labelling is omitted (e.g. labelling of non-confidential information to reduce workloads);\nb)\t how to label information sent by or stored on electronic or physical means, or any other format;\n\n\n23\n\nc)\t\nhow to handle cases where labelling is not possible (e.g. due to technical restrictions).\nExamples of labelling techniques include:\na)\t physical labels;\nb)\t headers and footers;\nc)\t\nmetadata;\nd)\t watermarking;\ne)\t rubber-stamps.\nDigital information should utilize metadata in order to identify, manage and control information, \nespecially with regard to confidentiality. Metadata should also enable efficient and correct searching for \ninformation. Metadata should facilitate systems to interact and make decisions based on the associated \nclassification labels.\nThe procedures should describe how to attach metadata to information, what labels to use and how \ndata should be handled, in line with the organization’s information model and ICT architecture.\nRelevant additional metadata should be added by systems when they process information depending \non its information security properties.\nPersonnel and other interested parties should be made aware of labelling procedures. All personnel \nshould be provided with the necessary training to ensure that information is correctly labelled and \nhandled accordingly.\nOutput from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should carry \nan appropriate classification label.\nOther information\nLabelling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing.\nOther useful metadata that can be attached to the information is which organizational process created \nthe information and at what time.\nLabelling of information and other associated assets can sometimes have negative effects. Classified \nassets can be easier to identify by malicious actors for potential misuse.\nSome systems do not label individual files or database records with their classification but protect all \ninformation at the highest level of classification of any of the information that it contains or is permitted \nto contain. It is usual in such systems to determine and then label information when it is exported.\n5.14\tInformation transfer\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Asset_management\n#Information_protection\n#Protection\nControl\nInformation transfer rules, procedures, or agreements should be in place for all types of transfer \nfacilities within the organization and between the organization and other parties.\n\t\n\n\n\n24\n\nPurpose\nTo maintain the security of information transferred within an organization and with any external \ninterested party.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on information transfer \nto all relevant interested parties. Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit \nshould reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between \nthe organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be \nestablished and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10).\nInformation transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and \nverbal transfer.\nFor all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:\na)\t controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access, \ncopying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access \ncontrol commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls \nthat are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see \n8.24);\nb)\t controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for \ninformation while in transit;\nc)\t\nidentification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk \nowners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;\nd)\t responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical \nstorage media or data;\ne)\t use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning \nof the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see \n5.13);\nf)\t\nreliability and availability of the transfer service;\ng)\t the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10);\nh)\t retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;\nNOTE\t\nLocal legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.\ni)\t\nthe consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements \n(see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic \nsignatures).\nElectronic transfer\nRules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic \ncommunication facilities for information transfer:\na)\t detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic \ncommunications (see 8.7);\nb)\t protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;\nc)\t\nprevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or \nnumber;\n\n\n25\n\nd)\t obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging, social \nnetworking, file sharing or cloud storage;\ne)\t stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks;\nf)\t\nrestrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic \nforwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);\ng)\t advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant \nmessages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by \nunauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;\nh)\t advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or \nservices, namely:\n1)\t unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;\n2)\t deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers.\nPhysical storage media transfer\nWhen transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should \nalso include:\na)\t responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;\nb)\t ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;\nc)\t\npackaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit \nand in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications, for example protecting against any \nenvironmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as \nexposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for \npackaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes);\nd)\t a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;\ne)\t courier identification standards;\nf)\t\ndepending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use \ntamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);\ng)\t procedures to verify the identification of couriers;\nh)\t approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the \nclassification of the information;\ni)\t\nkeeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as \nrecording the list of authorised recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and \nreceipt at the destination.\nVerbal transfer\nTo protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded \nthat they should:\na)\t not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication \nchannels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;\nb)\t not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages \nsince these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored \nincorrectly as a result of misdialling;\nc)\t\nbe screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;\n\t\n\n\n\n26\n\nd)\t ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door);\ne)\t begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level \nand any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.\nOther information\nNo other information.\n5.15\tAccess control\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\nControl\nRules to control physical and logical access to information and other associated assets should be \nestablished and implemented based on business and information security requirements.\nPurpose\nTo ensure authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other associated \nassets.\nGuidance\nOwners of information and other associated assets should determine information security and business \nrequirements related to access control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined which \ntakes account of these requirements and should be communicated to all relevant interested parties.\nThese requirements and the topic-specific policy should consider the following:\na)\t determining which entities require which type of access to the information and other associated \nassets;\nb)\t security of applications (see 8.26);\nc)\t\nphysical access, which needs to be supported by appropriate physical entry controls (see 7.2, 7.3, \n7.4);\nd)\t information dissemination and authorization (e.g. the need-to-know principle) and information \nsecurity levels and classification of information (see 5.10, 5.12, 5.13);\ne)\t restrictions to privileged access (see 8.2);\nf)\t\nsegregation of duties (see 5.3);\ng)\t relevant legislation, regulations and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to \ndata or services (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34, 8.3);\nh)\t segregation of access control functions (e.g. access request, access authorization, access \nadministration);\ni)\t\nformal authorization of access requests (see 5.16 and 5.18);\nj)\t\nthe management of access rights (see 5.18);\nk)\t logging (see 8.15).\n\n\n27\n\nAccess control rules should be implemented by defining and mapping appropriate access rights and \nrestrictions to the relevant entities (see 5.16). An entity can represent a human user as well as a \ntechnical or logical item (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control management, \nspecific roles can be assigned to entity groups.\nThe following should be taken into account when defining and implementing access control rules:\na)\t consistency between the access rights and information classification;\nb)\t consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter security needs and requirements;\nc)\t\nconsidering all types of available connections in distributed environments so entities are only \nprovided with access to information and other associated assets, including networks and network \nservices, that they are authorized to use;\nd)\t considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.\nOther information\nThere are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently \nused principles are:\na)\t need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in \norder to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and \nhence different access profiles);\nb)\t need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a \nclear need is present.\nCare should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:\na)\t establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless \nexpressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless \nexpressly forbidden”;\nb)\t changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing \nfacilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;\nc)\t\nchanges in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those \ninitiated by an administrator;\nd)\t when to define and regularly review the approval.\nAccess control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, \n8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17).\nThere are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC \n(discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access \ncontrol).\nAccess control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or \nspecific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging \nfrom covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties \nsuch as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and \nhow granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more \ngranularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used \nto define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.\n\t\n\n\n\n28\n\n5.16\tIdentity management\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\nControl\nThe full life cycle of identities should be managed.\nPurpose\nTo allow for the unique identification of individuals and systems accessing the organization’s \ninformation and other associated assets and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.\nGuidance\nThe processes used in the context of identity management should ensure that:\na)\t for identities assigned to persons, a specific identity is only linked to a single person to be able to \nhold the person accountable for actions performed with this specific identity;\nb)\t identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they \nare necessary for business or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and \ndocumentation;\nc)\t\nidentities assigned to non-human entities are subject to appropriately segregated approval and \nindependent ongoing oversight;\nd)\t identities are disabled or removed in a timely fashion if they are no longer required (e.g. if their \nassociated entities are deleted or no longer used, or if the person linked to an identity has left the \norganization or changed the role);\ne)\t in a specific domain, a single identity is mapped to a single entity, [i.e. mapping of multiple identities \nto the same entity within the same context (duplicate identities) is avoided];\nf)\t\nrecords of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and of \nauthentication information are kept.\nThe organization should have a supporting process in place to handle changes to information related \nto user identities. These processes can include re-verification of trusted documents related to a person.\nWhen using identities provided or issued by third parties (e.g. social media credentials), the organization \nshould ensure the third-party identities provide the required trust level and any associated risks are \nknown and sufficiently treated. This can include controls related to the third parties (see 5.19) as well \nas controls related to associated authentication information (see 5.17).\nOther information\nProviding or revoking access to information and other associated assets is usually a multi-step \nprocedure:\na)\t confirming the business requirements for an identity to be established;\nb)\t verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity;\nc)\t\nestablishing an identity;\nd)\t configuring and activating the identity. This also includes configuration and initial setup of related \nauthentication services;\n\n\n29\n\ne)\t providing or revoking specific access rights to the identity, based on appropriate authorization or \nentitlement decisions (see 5.18).\n5.17\tAuthentication information\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\nControl\nAllocation and management of authentication information should be controlled by a management \nprocess, including advising personnel on the appropriate handling of authentication information.\nPurpose\nTo ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of authentication processes.\nGuidance\nAllocation of authentication information\nThe allocation and management process should ensure that:\na)\t personal passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) generated automatically during \nenrolment processes as temporary secret authentication information are non-guessable and unique \nfor each person, and that users are required to change them after the first use;\nb)\t procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or \ntemporary authentication information;\nc)\t\nauthentication information, including temporary authentication information, is transmitted \nto users in a secure manner (e.g. over an authenticated and protected channel) and the use of \nunprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages for this purpose is avoided;\nd)\t users acknowledge receipt of authentication information;\ne)\t default authentication information as predefined or provided by vendors is changed immediately \nfollowing installation of systems or software;\nf)\t\nrecords of significant events concerning allocation and management of authentication information \nare kept and their confidentiality is granted, and that the record-keeping method is approved (e.g. \nby using an approved password vault tool).\nUser responsibilities\nAny person having access to or using authentication information should be advised to ensure that:\na)\t secret authentication information such as passwords are kept confidential. Personal secret \nauthentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used \nin the context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities are solely \nshared with authorized persons;\nb)\t affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of \nor any other indication of a compromise;\nc)\t\nwhen passwords are used as authentication information, strong passwords according to best \npractice recommendations are selected, for example:\n\t\n\n\n\n30\n\n1)\t passwords are not based on anything somebody else can easily guess or obtain using person-\nrelated information (e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth);\n2)\t passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations thereof;\n3)\t use easy to remember passphrases and try to include alphanumerical and special characters;\n4)\t passwords have a minimum length;\nd)\t the same passwords are not used across distinct services and systems;\ne)\t the obligation to follow these rules is also included in terms and conditions of employment (see \n6.2).\nPassword management system\nWhen passwords are used as authentication information, the password management system should:\na)\t allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to \naddress input errors;\nb)\t enforce strong passwords according to good practice recommendations [see c) of \"User \nresponsibilities];\nc)\t\nforce users to change their passwords at first login;\nd)\t enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security incident, or upon termination \nor change of employment when a user has known passwords for identities that remain active (e.g. \nshared identities);\ne)\t prevent re-use of previous passwords;\nf)\t\nprevent the use of commonly-used passwords and compromised usernames, password \ncombinations from hacked systems;\ng)\t not display passwords on the screen when being entered;\nh)\t store and transmit passwords in protected form.\nPassword encryption and hashing should be performed according to approved cryptographic \ntechniques for passwords (see 8.24).\nOther information\nPasswords or passphrases are a commonly used type of authentication information and are a common \nmeans of verifying a user’s identity. Other types of authentication information are cryptographic keys, \ndata stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce authentication codes and biometric \ndata such as iris scans or fingerprints. Additional information can be found in the ISO/IEC 24760 series.\nRequiring frequent change of passwords can be problematic because users can get annoyed by the \nfrequent changes, forget new passwords, note them down in unsafe places, or choose unsafe passwords. \nProvision of single sign on (SSO) or other authentication management tools (e.g. password vaults) \nreduces the amount of authentication information that users are required to protect and can thereby \nincrease the effectiveness of this control.

These processes and procedures should \ninclude those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the \nsupplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier’s products or services or for the \ntermination of use of a supplier’s products and services, such as:\na)\t identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial \nservices, ICT infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and \navailability of the organization's information;\nb)\t establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the sensitivity of information, \nproducts and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, on-\nsite assessments, certifications);\nc)\t\nevaluating and selecting supplier’s products or services that have adequate information security \ncontrols and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented \nby the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier’s information and information processing and \nhence the organization’s information security;\nd)\t defining the organization’s information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers \ncan access, monitor, control or use;\ne)\t defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can \naffect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information;\nf)\t\nassessing and managing the information security risks associated with:\n1)\t the suppliers’ use of the organization’s information and other associated assets, including risks \noriginating from potential malicious supplier personnel;\n2)\t malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including software components and sub-\ncomponents used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers;\ng)\t monitoring compliance with established information security requirements for each type of \nsupplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation;\nh)\t mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected through monitoring or by other \nmeans;\ni)\t\nhandling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier products and services including \nresponsibilities of both the organization and suppliers;\nj)\t\nresilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the \nsupplier’s information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization’s \ninformation;\nk)\t awareness and training for the organization’s personnel interacting with supplier personnel \nregarding appropriate rules of engagement, topic-specific policies, processes and procedures \nand behaviour based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization’s \nsystems and information;\nl)\t\nmanaging the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that \nneeds to be changed and ensuring that information security is maintained throughout the transfer \nperiod;\nm)\t requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including:\n1)\t de-provisioning of access rights;\n2)\t information handling;\n\t\n\n\n\n34\n\n3)\t determining ownership of intellectual property developed during the engagement;\n4)\t information portability in case of change of supplier or insourcing;\n6)\t records management;\n7)\t return of assets;\n8)\t secure disposal of information and other associated assets;\n9)\t ongoing confidentiality requirements;\nn)\t level of personnel security and physical security expected from supplier's personnel and facilities.\nThe procedures for continuing information processing in the event that the supplier becomes unable to \nsupply its products or services (e.g. because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business, \nor no longer provides some components due to technology advancements) should be considered to \navoid any delay in arranging replacement products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier \nin advance or always using alternative suppliers).\nOther information\nIn cases where it is not possible for an organization to place requirements on a supplier, the organization \nshould:\na)\t consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions about choosing a supplier and its \nproduct or service;\nb)\t implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk assessment.\nInformation can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate information security management. Controls \nshould be determined and applied to manage the supplier's access to information and other associated \nassets. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure \nagreements or cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data protection \nrisks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or access to, information across borders. The \norganization needs to be aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting information \nremains with the organization.\nRisks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure components or services provided \nby suppliers. Malfunctioning or vulnerable components or services can cause information security \nbreaches in the organization or to another entity (e.g. they can cause malware infection, attacks or \nother harm on entities other than the organization).\nSee ISO/IEC 27036-2 for more detail.\n5.20\tAddressing information security within supplier agreements\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Supplier_relation\nships_security\n#Governance_and_\nEcosystem #Protec\ntion\nControl\nRelevant information security requirements should be established and agreed with each supplier based \non the type of supplier relationship.\nPurpose\nTo maintain an agreed level of information security in supplier relationships.\n\n\n35\n\nGuidance\nSupplier agreements should be established and documented to ensure that there is clear understanding \nbetween the organization and the supplier regarding both parties’ obligations to fulfil relevant \ninformation security requirements.\nThe following terms can be considered for inclusion in the agreements in order to satisfy the identified \ninformation security requirements:\na)\t description of the information to be provided or accessed and methods of providing or accessing \nthe information;\nb)\t classification of information according to the organization’s classification scheme (see 5.10, 5.12, \n5.13);\nc)\t\nmapping between the organization’s own classification scheme and the classification scheme of the \nsupplier;\nd)\t legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements, including data protection, handling \nof personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property rights and copyright and a \ndescription of how it will be ensured that they are met;\ne)\t obligation of each contractual party to implement an agreed set of controls, including access \ncontrol, performance review, monitoring, reporting and auditing, and the supplier’s obligations to \ncomply with the organization’s information security requirements;\nf)\t\nrules of acceptable use of information and other associated assets, including unacceptable use if \nnecessary;\ng)\t procedures or conditions for authorization and removal of the authorization for the use of the \norganization’s information and other associated assets by supplier personnel (e.g. through an \nexplicit list of supplier personnel authorized to use the organization’s information and other \nassociated assets);\nh)\t information security requirements regarding the supplier’s ICT infrastructure;

Examples of such supplier review \nmethods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the \nsupplier’s information security operations;\ng)\t implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or service components that \nare critical for maintaining functionality and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny \nand further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier \noutsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers;\nh)\t obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be traced throughout the supply \nchain;\ni)\t\nobtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning as expected without any \nunexpected or unwanted features;\nj)\t\nimplementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from \ntheir specification. Example measures include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications \nor digital signatures. Monitoring for out of specification performance can be an indicator of \ntampering or counterfeits. Prevention and detection of tampering should be implemented during \nmultiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration, \noperations and maintenance;\nk)\t obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security levels, for example, through formal \ncertification or an evaluation scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement;\nl)\t\ndefining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain and any potential issues and \ncompromises among the organization and suppliers;\nm)\t implementing specific processes for managing ICT component life cycle and availability and \nassociated security risks. This includes managing the risks of components no longer being available \ndue to suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer providing these components due \nto technology advancements. Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to transfer \nsoftware and competence to the alternative supplier should be considered.\nOther information\nThe specific ICT supply chain risk management practices are built on top of general information \nsecurity, quality, project management and system engineering practices but do not replace them.\n\t\n\n\n\n38\n\nOrganizations are advised to work with suppliers to understand the ICT supply chain and any matters \nthat have an important effect on the products and services being provided. The organization can \ninfluence ICT supply chain information security practices by making clear in agreements with their \nsuppliers the matters that should be addressed by other suppliers in the ICT supply chain.\nICT should be acquired from reputable sources. The reliability of software and hardware is a matter \nof quality control. While it is generally not possible for an organization to inspect the quality control \nsystems of its vendors, it can make reliable judgments based on the reputation of the vendor.\nICT supply chain as addressed here includes cloud services.\nExamples of ICT supply chains are:\na)\t cloud services provisioning, where the cloud service provider relies on the software developers, \ntelecommunication service providers, hardware providers;\nb)\t IoT, where the service involves the device manufacturers, the cloud service providers (e.g. the \nIoT platform operators), the developers for mobile and web applications, the vendor of software \nlibraries;\nc)\t\nhosting services, where the provider relies on external service desks including first, second and \nthird support levels.\nSee ISO/IEC 27036-3 for more details including risk assessment guidance.\nSoftware identification (SWID) tags can also help to achieve better information security in the supply \nchain, by providing information about software provenance.

The BIA process \nshould use impact types and criteria to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of \nbusiness activities that deliver products and services. The magnitude and duration of the resulting \nimpact should be used to identify prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time \nobjective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are needed to support prioritized \nactivities. An RTO should also be specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should \ninclude ICT services.\nThe BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance and capacity requirements of \nICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO) of information required to support activities during \ndisruption.\nBased on the outputs from the BIA and risk assessment involving ICT services, the organization should \nidentify and select ICT continuity strategies that consider options for before, during and after disruption. \nThe business continuity strategies can comprise one or more solutions. Based on the strategies, plans \nshould be developed, implemented and tested to meet the required availability level of ICT services and \nin the required time frames following interruption to, or failure of, critical processes.\nThe organization should ensure that:\na)\t an adequate organizational structure is in place to prepare for, mitigate and respond to a disruption \nsupported by personnel with the necessary responsibility, authority and competence;\nb)\t ICT continuity plans, including response and recovery procedures detailing how the organization \nis planning to manage an ICT service disruption, are:\n1)\t regularly evaluated through exercises and tests;\n2)\t approved by management;\nc)\t\nICT continuity plans include the following ICT continuity information:\n1)\t performance and capacity specifications to meet the business continuity requirements and \nobjectives as specified in the BIA;\n2)\t RTO of each prioritized ICT service and the procedures for restoring those components;\n3)\t RPO of the prioritized ICT resources defined as information and the procedures for restoring \nthe information.\nOther information\nManaging ICT continuity forms a key part of business continuity requirements concerning availability \nto be able to:\na)\t respond and recover from disruption to ICT services regardless of the cause;\nb)\t ensure continuity of prioritized activities are supported by the required ICT services;\nc)\t\nrespond before a disruption to ICT services occurs, and upon detection of at least one incident that \ncan result in a disruption to ICT services.\n\n\n49\n\nFurther guidance on ICT readiness for business continuity can be found in ISO/IEC 27031.\nFurther guidance on business continuity management systems can be found in ISO 22301 and ISO 22313.\nFurther guidance on BIA can be found in ISO/TS 22317.\n5.31\tLegal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Legal_and_compli\nance\n#Governance_and_\nEcosystem #Protec\ntion\nControl\nLegal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements relevant to information security and the \norganization’s approach to meet these requirements should be identified, documented and kept up to \ndate.\nPurpose\nTo ensure compliance with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to \ninformation security.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nExternal requirements including legal, statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements should be \ntaken into consideration when:\na)\t developing information security policies and procedures;\nb)\t designing, implementing or changing information security controls;\nc)\t\nclassifying information and other associated assets as part of the process for setting information \nsecurity requirements for internal needs or for supplier agreements;\nd)\t performing information security risk assessments and determining information security risk \ntreatment activities;\ne)\t determining processes along with related roles and responsibilities relating to information \nsecurity;\nf)\t\ndetermining suppliers’ contractual requirements relevant to the organization and the scope of \nsupply of products and services.\nLegislation and regulations\nThe organization should:\na)\t identify all legislation and regulations relevant to the organization’s information security in order \nto be aware of the requirements for their type of business;\nb)\t take into consideration compliance in all relevant countries, if the organization:\n—\t conducts business in other countries;\n—\t uses products and services from other countries where laws and regulations can affect the \norganization;\n\t\n\n\n\n50\n\n—\t transfers information across jurisdictional borders where laws and regulations can affect the \norganization;\nc)\t\nreview the identified legislation and regulation regularly in order to keep up to date with the \nchanges and identify new legislation;\nd)\t define and document the specific processes and individual responsibilities to meet these \nrequirements.\nCryptography\nCryptography is an area that often has specific legal requirements.

See the ISO/IEC 19770 series for details about IT asset \nmanagement.\nData can be acquired from outside sources. It is generally the case that such data is obtained under the \nterms of a data sharing agreement or similar legal instrument. Such data sharing agreements should \nmake it clear what processing is permitted for the acquired data. It is also advisable that the provenance \nof the data is clearly stated. See ISO/IEC 23751:—1) for details about data sharing agreements.\nLegal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements can place restrictions on the copying \nof proprietary material. In particular, they can require that only material that is developed by the \norganization or that is licensed or provided by the developer to the organization, can be used. Copyright \ninfringement can lead to legal action, which can involve fines and criminal proceedings.\nAside from the organization needing to comply with its obligations towards third party intellectual \nproperty rights, the risks of personnel and third parties failing to uphold the organization’s own \nintellectual property rights should also be managed.\n1)\t Under preparation.

These guidelines should be aligned with the organization’s \ntopic-specific policy on records management and other records requirements;\nb)\t draw up a retention schedule defining records and the period of time for which they should be \nretained.\nThe system of storage and handling should ensure identification of records and of their retention \nperiod taking into consideration national or regional legislation or regulations, as well as community or \nsocietal expectations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after \nthat period if they are not needed by the organization.\nWhen deciding on protection of specific organizational records, their corresponding information \nsecurity classification, based on the organization’s classification scheme, should be considered. \nRecords should be categorized into record types (e.g. accounting records, business transaction records, \npersonnel records, legal records), each with details of retention periods and type of allowable storage \nmedia which can be physical or electronic.\nData storage systems should be chosen such that required records can be retrieved in an acceptable \ntime frame and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.\nWhere electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access records (both \nstorage media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be established to \nsafeguard against loss due to future technology change. Any related cryptographic keys and programs \nassociated with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be retained to enable decryption \nof the records for the length of time the records are retained (see 8.24).\nStorage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with recommendations \nprovided by manufacturers of storage media. Consideration should be given to the possibility of \ndeterioration of media used for storage of records.\nOther information\nRecords document individual events or transactions or can form aggregations that have been designed \nto document work processes, activities or functions. They are both evidence of business activity and \ninformation assets. Any set of information, regardless of its structure or form, can be managed as a \n\n\n53\n\nrecord. This includes information in the form of a document, a collection of data or other types of digital \nor analogue information which are created, captured and managed in the course of business.\nIn the management of records, metadata is data describing the context, content and structure of \nrecords, as well as their management over time. Metadata is an essential component of any record.\nIt can be necessary to retain some records securely to meet legal, statutory, regulatory or contractual \nrequirements, as well as to support essential business activities. National law or regulation can set the \ntime period and data content for information retention.

These procedures should be communicated to all relevant interested parties involved \nin the processing of personally identifiable information.\nCompliance with these procedures and all relevant legislation and regulations concerning the \npreservation of privacy and protection of PII requires appropriate roles, responsibilities and controls. \nOften this is best achieved by the appointment of a person responsible, such as a privacy officer, who \nshould provide guidance to personnel, service providers and other interested parties on their individual \nresponsibilities and the specific procedures that should be followed.\nResponsibility for handling PII should be dealt with taking into consideration relevant legislation and \nregulations.\nAppropriate technical and organizational measures to protect PII should be implemented.\nOther information\nA number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing, \ntransmission and deletion of PII. Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls can \nimpose duties on those collecting, processing and disseminating PII and can also restrict the authority \nto transfer PII to other countries.\nISO/IEC 29100 provides a high-level framework for the protection of PII within ICT systems. Further \ninformation on privacy information management systems can be found in ISO/IEC 27701. Specific \ninformation regarding privacy information management for public clouds acting as PII processors can \nbe found in ISO/IEC 27018.\n\t\n\n\n\n54\n\nISO/IEC 29134 provides guidelines for privacy impact assessment (PIA) and gives an example of the \nstructure and content of a PIA report.

Water pumps or equivalent means \nshould be readily made available in case flooding occurs;\nc)\t\nelectrical surges: adopting systems able to protect both server and client information systems \nagainst electrical surges or similar events to minimize the consequences of such events;\nd)\t explosives and weapons: performing random inspections for the presence of explosives or weapons \non personnel, vehicles or goods entering sensitive information processing facilities.\nOther information\nSafes or other forms of secure storage facilities can protect information stored therein against disasters \nsuch as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion.\nOrganizations can consider the concepts of crime prevention through environmental design when \ndesigning the controls to secure their environment and reduce urban threats. For example, instead of \nusing bollards, statues or water features can serve as both a feature and a physical barrier.\n7.6\t Working in secure areas\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Physical_security\n#Protection\nControl\nSecurity measures for working in secure areas should be designed and implemented.\n\t\n\n\n\n72\n\nPurpose\nTo protect information and other associated assets in secure areas from damage and unauthorized \ninterference by personnel working in these areas.\nGuidance\nThe security measures for working in secure areas should apply to all personnel and cover all activities \ntaking place in the secure area.\nThe following guidelines should be considered:\na)\t making personnel aware only of the existence of, or activities within, a secure area on a need-to-\nknow basis;\nb)\t avoiding unsupervised work in secure areas both for safety reasons and to reduce chances for \nmalicious activities;\nc)\t\nphysically locking and periodically inspecting vacant secure areas;\nd)\t not allowing photographic, video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras in user \nendpoint devices, unless authorized;\ne)\t appropriately controlling the carrying and use of user endpoint devices in secure areas;\nf)\t\nposting emergency procedures in a readily visible or accessible manner.\nOther information\nNo other information.\n7.7\t Clear desk and clear screen\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Protect\n#Physical_security\n#Protection\nControl\nClear desk rules for papers and removable storage media and clear screen rules for information \nprocessing facilities should be defined and appropriately enforced.\nPurpose\nTo reduce the risks of unauthorized access, loss of and damage to information on desks, screens and in \nother accessible locations during and outside normal working hours.\nGuidance\nThe organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on clear desk and clear \nscreen to all relevant interested parties.\nThe following guidelines should be considered:\na)\t locking away sensitive or critical business information (e.g. on paper or on electronic storage \nmedia) (ideally in a safe, cabinet or other form of security furniture) when not required, especially \nwhen the office is vacated;\nb)\t protecting user endpoint devices by key locks or other security means when not in use or \nunattended;\n\n\n73\n\nc)\t\nleaving user endpoint devices logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard locking \nmechanism controlled by a user authentication mechanism when unattended.

The topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel and \nconsider the following:\na)\t the type of information and the classification level that the user endpoint devices can handle, \nprocess, store or support;\nb)\t registration of user endpoint devices;\nc)\t\nrequirements for physical protection;\nd)\t restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by system administrators);\ne)\t requirements for user endpoint device software (including software versions) and for applying \nupdates (e.g. active automatic updating);\nf)\t\nrules for connection to information services, public networks or any other network off premises \n(e.g. requiring the use of personal firewall);\ng)\t access controls;\nh)\t storage device encryption;\n\n\n81\n\ni)\t\nprotection against malware;\nj)\t\nremote disabling, deletion or lockout;\nk)\t backups;\nl)\t\nusage of web services and web applications;\nm)\t end user behaviour analytics (see 8.16);\nn)\t the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices, and the possibility of disabling \nphysical ports (e.g. USB ports);\no)\t the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user endpoint device, which can securely \nseparate the organization's information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other \ninformation and other associated assets on the device.\nConsideration should be given as to whether certain information is so sensitive that it can only be \naccessed via user endpoint devices, but not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical \nsafeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline \nworking is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled.\nAs far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration \nmanagement (see 8.9) or automated tools.\nUser responsibility\nAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user \nendpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users \nshould be advised to:\na)\t log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed;\nb)\t protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or \nspecial locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying \nimportant, sensitive or critical business information unattended;\nc)\t\nuse devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected \nareas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy \nscreen filters);\nd)\t physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport, \nhotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places).\nA specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance) \nand other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of \nuser endpoint devices.\nUse of personal devices\nWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to \nthe guidance given in this control, the following should be considered:\na)\t separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such \nseparation and protect business data on a private device;\nb)\t providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical \nprotection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping \nof data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use \nthe service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered;\nc)\t\ntopic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property \ndeveloped on privately owned equipment;\n\t\n\n\n\n82\n\nd)\t access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an \ninvestigation), which can be prevented by legislation;\ne)\t software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for \nclient software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.\nWireless connections\nThe organization should establish procedures for:\na)\t the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols);\nb)\t using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant \ntopic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).\nOther information\nControls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device \nis used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is \nexposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization.\nThe wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections \nbut have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. In particular, \nback-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network \nbandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are \nscheduled.\nFor some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other \npurposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).\n8.2\t Privileged access rights\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational capa\nbilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\nControl\nThe allocation and use of privileged access rights should be restricted and managed.\nPurpose\nTo ensure only authorized users, software components and services are provided with privileged \naccess rights.\nGuidance\nThe allocation of privileged access rights should be controlled through an authorization process in \naccordance with the relevant topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15). The following should be \nconsidered:\na)\t identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system or process (e.g. operating \nsystems, database management systems and applications);\nb)\t allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an event-by-event basis in line with \nthe topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15) (i.e. only to individuals with the necessary \ncompetence to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum \nrequirement for their functional roles);\n\n\n83\n\nc)\t\nmaintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can approve privileged access rights, \nor not granting privileged access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a record of \nall privileges allocated;\nd)\t defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged access rights;\ne)\t taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged access rights and when they are \nin privileged access mode. Possible measures include using specific user identities, user interface \nsettings or even specific equipment;\nf)\t\nauthentication requirements for privileged access rights can be higher than the requirements for \nnormal access rights. Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary before doing \nwork with privileged access rights;\ng)\t regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users working with privileged access \nrights in order to verify if their duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them for \nworking with privileged access rights (see 5.18);\nh)\t establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (such as \n“root”), depending on systems’ configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication \ninformation of such identities (see 5.17);\ni)\t\ngranting temporary privileged access just for the time window necessary to implement approved \nchanges or activities (e.g. for maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than \npermanently granting privileged access rights. This is often referred as break glass procedure, and \noften automated by privilege access management technologies;\nj)\t\nlogging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes;\nk)\t not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to multiple persons, assigning each \nperson a separate identity which allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities \ncan be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to simplify the management of \nprivileged access rights;\nl)\t\nonly using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking administrative tasks and not \nfor day-to-day general tasks [i.e. checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate \nnormal network identity for these activities)].\nOther information\nPrivileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a role or a process that allows the \nperformance of activities that typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles \ntypically require privileged access rights.\nInappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or facility of an information system \nthat enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to \nfailures or breaches of systems.\nMore information related to access management and the secure management of access to information \nand information and communications technologies resources can be found in ISO/IEC 29146.\n8.3\t Information access restriction\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\n\t\n\n\n\n84\n\nControl\nAccess to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the \nestablished topic-specific policy on access control.\nPurpose\nTo ensure only authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other \nassociated assets.\nGuidance\nAccess to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the \nestablished topic-specific policies. The following should be considered in order to support access \nrestriction requirements:\na)\t not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public \nor anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive \ninformation;\nb)\t providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and \nservices;\nc)\t\ncontrolling which data can be accessed by a particular user;\nd)\t controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and \nexecute;\ne)\t providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application \ndata, or systems.\nFurther, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that \nhas high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:\na)\t needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;\nb)\t wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over \nwho can access it;\nc)\t\nwants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;\nd)\t wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution \n(including printing);\ne)\t wants to monitor the use of the information;\nf)\t\nwants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is \nrequired.\nDynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e. \ncreation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:\na)\t establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:\n1)\t granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;\n2)\t leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be \nprotected with dynamic access management techniques;\nb)\t establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical \ninfrastructure.\n\n\n85\n\nDynamic access management systems should protect information by:\na)\t requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information;\nb)\t restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular \ndate);\nc)\t\nusing encryption to protect information;\nd)\t defining the printing permissions for the information;\ne)\t recording who accesses the information and how the information is used;\nf)\t\nraising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.\nOther information\nDynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can \nsupport the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization, \nwhere traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to documents, emails or other \nfiles containing information to limit who can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular \nlevel and be adapted over the life cycle of the information.\nDynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access management [e.g. using access \ncontrol lists (ACLs)], but can add more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time data \nreduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most sensitive information. It offers a \nway to control access outside the organization’s environment. Incident response can be supported by \ndynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or revoked at any time.\nAdditional information on a framework for access management is provided in ISO/IEC 29146.\n8.4\t Access to source code\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_access_\nmanagement\n#Application_security\n#Secure_configura\ntion\n#Protection\nControl\nRead and write access to source code, development tools and software libraries should be appropriately \nmanaged.\nPurpose\nTo prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality, avoid unintentional or malicious changes \nand to maintain the confidentiality of valuable intellectual property.\nGuidance\nAccess to source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans and \nvalidation plans) and development tools (e.g. compilers, builders, integration tools, test platforms and \nenvironments) should be strictly controlled.\nFor source code, this can be achieved by controlling central storage of such code, preferably in source \ncode management system.\nRead access and write access to source code can differ based on the personnel’s role. For example, read \naccess to source code can be broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source code \n\t\n\n\n\n86\n\nis only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners. Where code components are used \nby several developers within an organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be \nimplemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code components are used inside an \norganization, read access to such external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write \naccess should still be restricted.\nThe following guidelines should be considered to control access to program source libraries in order to \nreduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:\na)\t managing the access to program source code and the program source libraries according to \nestablished procedures;\nb)\t granting read and write access to source code based on business needs and managed to address \nrisks of alteration or misuse and according to established procedures;\nc)\t\nupdating of source code and associated items and granting of access to source code in accordance \nwith change control procedures (see 8.32) and only performing it after appropriate authorization \nhas been received;\nd)\t not granting developers direct access to the source code repository, but through developer tools \nthat control activities and authorizations on the source code;\ne)\t holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and write access should be \nappropriately managed and assigned;\nf)\t\nmaintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to source code.\nIf the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to provide assurance on its \nintegrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.\nOther information\nIf access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can be modified or some data in the \ndevelopment environment (e.g. copies of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by \nunauthorized persons.\n8.5\t Secure authentication\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Identity_and_ac\ncess_management\n#Protection\nControl\nSecure authentication technologies and procedures should be implemented based on information \naccess restrictions and the topic-specific policy on access control.\nPurpose\nTo ensure a user or an entity is securely authenticated, when access to systems, applications and \nservices is granted.\nGuidance\nA suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user, \nsoftware, messages and other entities.\nThe strength of authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information to be \naccessed. Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods \n\n\n87\n\nalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be \nused.\nAuthentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing \ncritical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of \nmultiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces \nthe possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other \ntechniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and \npatterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.\nBiometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric \nauthentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To \nprepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative \nauthentication technique.\nThe procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of \nunauthorized access. Log-on procedures and technologies should be implemented considering the \nfollowing:\na)\t not displaying sensitive system or application information until the log-on process has been \nsuccessfully completed in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary \nassistance;\nb)\t displaying a general notice warning that the system or the application or the service should only be \naccessed by authorized users;\nc)\t\nnot providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user (e.g. \nif an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or \nincorrect);\nd)\t validating the log-on information only on completion of all input data;\ne)\t protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and passwords [e.g. using completely \nautomated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password \nreset after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user after a maximum number of \nerrors];\nf)\t\nlogging unsuccessful and successful attempts;\ng)\t raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on controls is detected \n(e.g. sending an alert to the user and the organization’s system administrators when a certain \nnumber of wrong password attempts has been reached);\nh)\t displaying or sending the following information on a separate channel on completion of a successful \nlog-on:\n1)\t date and time of the previous successful log-on;\n2)\t details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on;\ni)\t\nnot displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in some cases, it can be required \nto de-activate this functionality in order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or to \navoid blocking users because of repeated errors);\nj)\t\nnot transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid being captured by a network \n\"sniffer” program;\nk)\t terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations \nsuch as public or external areas outside the organization’s security management or on user \nendpoint devices;\n\t\n\n\n\n88\n\nl)\t\nrestricting connection duration times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and \nreduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.\nOther information\nAdditional information on entity authentication assurance can be found is ISO/IEC 29115.\n8.6\t Capacity management\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify #Protect\n#Detect\n#Continuity\n#Governance_and_\nEcosystem #Protec\ntion\nControl\nThe use of resources should be monitored and adjusted in line with current and expected capacity \nrequirements.\nPurpose\nTo ensure the required capacity of information processing facilities, human resources, offices and other \nfacilities.\nGuidance\nCapacity requirements for information processing facilities, human resources, offices and other \nfacilities should be identified, taking into account the business criticality of the concerned systems and \nprocesses.\nSystem tuning and monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the \navailability and efficiency of systems.\nThe organization should perform stress-tests of systems and services to confirm that sufficient system \ncapacity is available to meet peak performance requirements.\nDetective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time.\nProjections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system \nrequirements and current and projected trends in the organization’s information processing \ncapabilities.\nParticular attention should be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs. \nTherefore, managers, service or product owners should monitor the utilization of key system resources.\nManagers should use capacity information to identify and avoid potential resource limitations and \ndependency on key personnel which can present a threat to system security or services and plan \nappropriate action.\nProviding sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity or by reducing demand. The \nfollowing should be considered to increase capacity:\na)\t hiring new personnel;\nb)\t obtaining new facilities or space;\nc)\t\nacquiring more powerful processing systems, memory and storage;\nd)\t making use of cloud computing, which has inherent characteristics that directly address issues of \ncapacity. Cloud computing has elasticity and scalability which enable on-demand rapid expansion \nand reduction in resources available to particular applications and services.\n\n\n89\n\nThe following should be considered to reduce demand on the organization’s resources:\na)\t deletion of obsolete data (disk space);\nb)\t disposal of hardcopy records that have met their retention period (free up shelving space);\nc)\t\ndecommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments;\nd)\t optimizing batch processes and schedules;\ne)\t optimizing application code or database queries;\nf)\t\ndenying or restricting bandwidth for resource-consuming services if these are not critical (e.g. \nvideo streaming).\nA documented capacity management plan should be considered for mission critical systems.\nOther information\nFor more detail on the elasticity and scalability of cloud computing, see ISO/IEC TS 23167.\n8.7\t Protection against malware\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n#Corrective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect #Detect\n#System_and_network_\nsecurity\n#Information_protec\ntion\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nProtection against malware should be implemented and supported by appropriate user awareness.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information and other associated assets are protected against malware.\nGuidance\nProtection against malware should be based on malware detection and repair software, information \nsecurity awareness, appropriate system access and change management controls. Use of malware \ndetection and repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance should be \nconsidered:\na)\t implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software [e.g. \napplication allowlisting (i.e. using a list providing allowed applications)] (see 8.19 and 8.32);\nb)\t implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites \n(e.g. blocklisting);\nc)\t\nreducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware [e.g. through technical vulnerability \nmanagement (see 8.8 and 8.19)];\nd)\t conducting regular automated validation of the software and data content of systems, especially \nfor systems supporting critical business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved \nfiles or unauthorized amendments;\ne)\t establishing protective measures against risks associated with obtaining files and software either \nfrom or via external networks or on any other medium;\n\t\n\n\n\n90\n\nf)\t\ninstalling and regularly updating malware detection and repair software to scan computers and \nelectronic storage media. Carrying out regular scans that include:\n1)\t scanning any data received over networks or via any form of electronic storage media, for \nmalware before use;\n2)\t scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads for malware before use. \nCarrying out this scan at different places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when \nentering the network of the organization;\n3)\t scanning webpages for malware when accessed;\ng)\t determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and repair tools based on risk \nassessment outcomes and considering:\n1)\t defence in depth principles where they would be most effective. For example, this can lead to \nmalware detection in a network gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file \ntransfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers;\n2)\t the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted files) to deliver malware or the \nuse of encryption protocols to transmit malware;\nh)\t taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency \nprocedures, which can bypass normal controls against malware;\ni)\t\nimplementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently disable some or all measures \nagainst malware, including exception approval authorities, documented justification and review \ndate. This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes disruption to normal \noperations;\nj)\t\npreparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including \nall necessary data and software backup (including both online and offline backup) and recovery \nmeasures (see 8.13);\nk)\t isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur;\nl)\t\ndefining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection against malware on systems, \nincluding training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;\nm)\t providing awareness or training (see 6.3) to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate \nthe receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files or programs [the information \ncollected in n) and o) can be used to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date];\nn)\t implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new malware, such as subscribing \nto mailing lists or reviewing relevant websites;\no)\t verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning bulletins, comes from qualified \nand reputable sources (e.g. reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection software) and \nis accurate and informative.\nOther information\nIt is not always possible to install software that protects against malware on some systems (e.g. some \nindustrial control systems). Some forms of malware infect computer operating systems and computer \nfirmware such that common malware controls cannot clean the system and a full reimaging of the \noperating system software and sometimes the computer firmware is necessary to return to a secure \nstate.\n\n\n91\n\n8.8\t Management of technical vulnerabilities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Protect\n#Threat_and_\nvulnerability_\nmanagement\n#Governance_and_Ecosys\ntem\n#Protection #Defence\nControl\nInformation about technical vulnerabilities of information systems in use should be obtained, the \norganization’s exposure to such vulnerabilities should be evaluated and appropriate measures should \nbe taken.\nPurpose\nTo prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.\nGuidance\nIdentifying technical vulnerabilities\nThe organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see 5.9 to 5.14) as a prerequisite for \neffective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should include the software vendor, \nsoftware name, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what \nsystems) and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software.\nTo identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should consider:\na)\t defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability \nmanagement, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset \ntracking and any coordination responsibilities required;\nb)\t for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory list, see 5.9), identifying \ninformation resources that will be used for identifying relevant technical vulnerabilities and \nmaintaining awareness about them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in \nthe inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;\nc)\t\nrequiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability \nreporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);\nd)\t using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities \nand to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;\ne)\t conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments \nby competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising \ncaution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;\nf)\t\ntracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should be \nincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).\nThe organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:\na)\t detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component \nused in these;\nb)\t receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.\nThe organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability \ndisclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish \nvulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat \nintelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programs \n\t\n\n\n\n92\n\nwhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order \nto appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent \nindustry bodies or other interested parties.\nEvaluating technical vulnerabilities\nTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:\na)\t analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;\nb)\t once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and \nthe actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other \ncontrols.\nTaking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilities\nA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved \npatches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the \noriginal software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should \nbe fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. \nIf required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.\nThe following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:\na)\t taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical \nvulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical \nvulnerabilities;\nb)\t depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action \naccording to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information \nsecurity incident response procedures (see 5.26);\nc)\t\nonly using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);\nd)\t testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not \nresult in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks \nassociated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared \nwith the risk of installing the update)];\ne)\t addressing systems at high risk first;\nf)\t\ndevelop remediation (typically software updates or patches);\ng)\t test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;\nh)\t provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;\ni)\t\nif no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:\n1)\t applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;\n2)\t turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;\n3)\t adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);\n4)\t shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of \nsuitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);\n5)\t increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;\n6)\t raising awareness of the vulnerability.\n\n\n93\n\nFor acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their \nsoftware and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide \nwhether to use the automatic update or not.\nOther considerations\nAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.\nThe technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order \nto ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.\nAn effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management \nactivities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide \ntechnical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.\nWhere the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical \nvulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service \nprovider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should \nbe part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service \nprovider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are \nrespective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, \nthe cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the \ncloud services.\nOther information\nTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as \nsuch can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).\nThere is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side \neffects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been \napplied.\nIf adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in \nupdating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other \nusers. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.\nWhere software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an \nautomated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without \nthe need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can \nallow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of \nthe installation of the update.\nWhere the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected \nsystems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the \nautomated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over \nwhen the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated \nuntil the operation has completed.\nA weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: \ntwo countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked \nby strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability \nscanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care \nin reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.\nMany organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization \nbut also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, \nproducts and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.\n\t\n\n\n\n94\n\nOrganizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically \nthrough a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database \nservices.\nFor more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud \ncomputing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.\nISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing \nvulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving \nreported vulnerabilities.\n8.9 Configuration management\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Secure_configuration #Protection\nControl\nConfigurations, including security configurations, of hardware, software, services and networks should \nbe established, documented, implemented, monitored and reviewed.\nPurpose\nTo ensure hardware, software, services and networks function correctly with required security \nsettings, and configuration is not altered by unauthorized or incorrect changes.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should define and implement processes and tools to enforce the defined configurations \n(including security configurations) for hardware, software, services (e.g. cloud services) and networks, \nfor newly installed systems as well as for operational systems over their lifetime.\nRoles, responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all \nconfiguration changes.\nStandard templates\nStandard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and networks should \nbe defined:\na)\t using publicly available guidance (e.g. pre-defined templates from vendors and from independent \nsecurity organizations);\nb)\t considering the level of protection needed in order to determine a sufficient level of security;\nc)\t\nsupporting the organization’s information security policy, topic-specific policies, standards and \nother security requirements;\nd)\t considering the feasibility and applicability of security configurations in the organization’s context.\nThe templates should be reviewed periodically and updated when new threats or vulnerabilities need \nto be addressed, or when new software or hardware versions are introduced.\nThe following should be considered for establishing standard templates for the secure configuration of \nhardware, software, services and networks:\na)\t minimizing the number of identities with privileged or administrator level access rights;\n\n\n95\n\nb)\t disabling unnecessary, unused or insecure identities;\nc)\t\ndisabling or restricting unnecessary functions and services;\nd)\t restricting access to powerful utility programs and host parameter settings;\ne)\t synchronizing clocks;\nf)\t\nchanging vendor default authentication information such as default passwords immediately after \ninstallation and reviewing other important default security-related parameters;\ng)\t invoking time-out facilities that automatically log off computing devices after a predetermined \nperiod of inactivity;\nh)\t verifying that licence requirements have been met (see 5.32).\nManaging configurations\nEstablished configurations of hardware, software, services and networks should be recorded and a log \nshould be maintained of all configuration changes. These records should be securely stored. This can \nbe achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates.\nChanges to configurations should follow the change management process (see 8.32).\nConfiguration records can contain as relevant:\na)\t up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;\nb)\t date of the last change of configuration;\nc)\t\nversion of configuration template;\nd)\t relation to configurations of other assets.\nMonitoring configurations\nConfigurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system management tools (e.g. \nmaintenance utilities, remote support, enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and \nshould be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings, evaluate password strengths \nand assess activities performed. Actual configurations can be compared with the defined target \ntemplates. Any deviations should be addressed, either by automatic enforcement of the defined target \nconfiguration or by manual analysis of the deviation followed by corrective actions.\nOther information\nDocumentation for systems often records details about the configuration of both hardware and \nsoftware.\nSystem hardening is a typical part of configuration management.\nConfiguration management can be integrated with asset management processes and associated tooling.\nAutomation is usually more effective to manage security configuration (e.g. using infrastructure as \ncode).\nConfiguration templates and targets can be confidential information and should be protected from \nunauthorized access accordingly.\n\t\n\n\n\n96\n\n8.10\tInformation deletion\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Protect\n#Information_pro\ntection\n#Legal_and_compli\nance\n#Protection\nControl\nInformation stored in information systems, devices or in any other storage media should be deleted \nwhen no longer required.\nPurpose\nTo prevent unnecessary exposure of sensitive information and to comply with legal, statutory, \nregulatory and contractual requirements for information deletion.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nSensitive information should not be kept for longer than it is required to reduce the risk of undesirable \ndisclosure.\nWhen deleting information on systems, applications and services, the following should be considered:\na)\t selecting a deletion method (e.g. electronic overwriting or cryptographic erasure) in accordance \nwith business requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations;\nb)\t recording the results of deletion as evidence;\nc)\t\nwhen using service suppliers of information deletion, obtaining evidence of information deletion \nfrom them.\nWhere third parties store the organization’s information on its behalf, the organization should consider \nthe inclusion of requirements on information deletion into the third-party agreements to enforce it \nduring and upon termination of such services.\nDeletion methods\nIn accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on data retention and taking into \nconsideration relevant legislation and regulations, sensitive information should be deleted when no \nlonger required, by:\na)\t configuring systems to securely destroy information when no longer required (e.g. after a defined \nperiod subject to the topic-specific policy on data retention or by subject access request);\nb)\t deleting obsolete versions, copies and temporary files wherever they are located;\nc)\t\nusing approved, secure deletion software to permanently delete information to help ensure \ninformation cannot be recovered by using specialist recovery or forensic tools;\nd)\t using approved, certified providers of secure disposal services;\ne)\t using disposal mechanisms appropriate for the type of storage media being disposed of (e.g. \ndegaussing hard disk drives and other magnetic storage media).\nWhere cloud services are used, the organization should verify if the deletion method provided by the \ncloud service provider is acceptable, and if it is the case, the organization should use it, or request that \nthe cloud service provider delete the information. These deletion processes should be automated in \n\n\n97\n\naccordance with topic-specific policies, when available and applicable. Depending on the sensitivity of \ninformation deleted, logs can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened.\nTo avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when equipment is being sent back to \nvendors, sensitive information should be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk \ndrives) and memory before equipment leaves the organization’s premises.\nConsidering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g. smartphones) can only be achieved through \ndestruction or using the functions embedded in these devices (e.g. “restore factory settings”), the \norganization should choose the appropriate method according to the classification of information \nhandled by such devices.\nControl measures described in 7.14 should be applied to physically destroy the storage device and \nsimultaneously delete the information it contains.\nAn official record of information deletion is useful when analysing the cause of a possible information \nleakage event.\nOther information\nInformation on user data deletion in cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.\nInformation on deletion of PII can be found in ISO/IEC 27555.\n8.11\tData masking\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Protect\n#Information_protection #Protection\nControl\nData masking should be used in accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on access \ncontrol and other related topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable \nlegislation into consideration.\nPurpose\nTo limit the exposure of sensitive data including PII, and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and \ncontractual requirements.\nGuidance\nWhere the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the organization should consider hiding \nsuch data by using techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.\nPseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise the true identity of PII principals \nor other sensitive information, and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII principal \nor the link between other sensitive information.\nWhen using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be verified that data has been \nadequately pseudonymized or anonymized. Data anonymization should consider all the elements \nof the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can \nbe identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of \nfurther data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.\nAdditional techniques for data masking include:\na)\t encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);\nb)\t nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);\n\t\n\n\n\n98\n\nc)\t\nvarying numbers and dates;\nd)\t substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);\ne)\t replacing values with their hash.\nThe following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:\na)\t not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show \nonly the minimum required data to the user;\nb)\t there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of \ndata; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient \ndoes not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the \nhospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff \nwith specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);\nc)\t\nwhen data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if \nthe data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example \nif the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or \nresults of blood exams has been obfuscated);\nd)\t any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information \nduring processing or storage).\nThe following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:\na)\t level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of \nthe processed data;\nb)\t access controls to the processed data;\nc)\t\nagreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;\nd)\t prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;\ne)\t keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.\nOther information\nAnonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified \ndirectly or indirectly.\nPseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm \n(sometimes referred to as the “additional information”) used to perform the pseudonymization allows \nfor at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such “additional information” should \ntherefore be kept separate and protected.\nWhile pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be \nmore useful in statistical research.\nData masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking \ncan be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and \nrules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application’s memory).\nHash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they \nshould always be combined with a salt function.\nPII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should \nbe either avoided or appropriately anonymized.\nAdditional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.\n\n\n99\n\nAdditional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.\n8.12\tData leakage prevention\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n#Confidentiality\n#Protect #Detect\n#Information_pro\ntection\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nData leakage prevention measures should be applied to systems, networks and any other devices that \nprocess, store or transmit sensitive information.\nPurpose\nTo detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or \nsystems.\nGuidance\nThe organization should consider the following to reduce the risk of data leakage:\na)\t identifying and classifying information to protect against leakage (e.g. personal information, \npricing models and product designs);\nb)\t monitoring channels of data leakage (e.g. email, file transfers, mobile devices and portable storage \ndevices);\nc)\t\nacting to prevent information from leaking (e.g. quarantine emails containing sensitive \ninformation).\nData leakage prevention tools should be used to:\na)\t identify and monitor sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure (e.g. in unstructured \ndata on a user’s system);\nb)\t detect the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. when information is uploaded to untrusted \nthird-party cloud services or sent via email);\nc)\t\nblock user actions or network transmissions that expose sensitive information (e.g. preventing the \ncopying of database entries into a spreadsheet).\nThe organization should determine if it is necessary to restrict a user’s ability to copy and paste or \nupload data to services, devices and storage media outside of the organization. If that is the case, the \norganization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration \nof existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste \noutside of the organization’s control.\nIf data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users \naccountable for their actions.\nTaking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of \nuse, training and auditing.\nWhere data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using \nmeasures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the \nbackup.\nData leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an \nadversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial, \nscientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The \n\t\n\n\n\n100\n\ndata leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary’s decisions for example by \nreplacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as response \nto the adversary’s intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering \nor the use of honeypots to attract attackers.\nOther information\nData leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and \ntake actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the \ntransfer of data to portable storage devices).\nData leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel’s communications and online \nactivities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be \nconsidered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to \nprivacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to \nmonitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention.\nData leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies \non access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).\n8.13\tInformation backup\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Corrective\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Recover\n#Continuity\n#Protection\nControl\nBackup copies of information, software and systems should be maintained and regularly tested in \naccordance with the agreed topic-specific policy on backup.\nPurpose\nTo enable recovery from loss of data or systems.\nGuidance\nA topic-specific policy on backup should be established to address the organization’s data retention and \ninformation security requirements.\nAdequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can \nbe recovered following an incident or failure or loss of storage media.\nPlans should be developed and implemented for how the organization will back up information, \nsoftware and systems, to address the topic-specific policy on backup.\nWhen designing a backup plan, the following items should be taken into consideration:\na)\t producing accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration \nprocedures;\nb)\t reflecting the business requirements of the organization (e.g. the recovery point objective, see \n5.30), the security requirements of the information involved and the criticality of the information \nto the continued operation of the organization in the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and \nfrequency of backups;\nc)\t\nstoring the backups in a safe and secure remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any \ndamage from a disaster at the main site;\nd)\t giving backup information an appropriate level of physical and environmental protection (see \nClause 7 and 8.1) consistent with the standards applied at the main site;\n\n\n101\n\ne)\t regularly testing backup media to ensure that they can be relied on for emergency use when \nnecessary. Testing the ability to restore backed-up data onto a test system, not by overwriting the \noriginal storage media in case the backup or restoration process fails and causes irreparable data \ndamage or loss;\nf)\t\nprotecting backups by means of encryption according to the identified risks (e.g. in situations \nwhere confidentiality is of importance);\ng)\t taking care to ensure that inadvertent data loss is detected before backup is taken.\nOperational procedures should monitor the execution of backups and address failures of scheduled \nbackups to ensure completeness of backups according to the topic-specific policy on backups.\nBackup measures for individual systems and services should be regularly tested to ensure that they \nmeet the objectives of incident response and business continuity plans (see 5.30). This should be \ncombined with a test of the restoration procedures and checked against the restoration time required \nby the business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems and services, backup measures should \ncover all systems information, applications and data necessary to recover the complete system in the \nevent of a disaster.\nWhen the organization uses a cloud service, backup copies of the organization’s information, \napplications and systems in the cloud service environment should be taken. The organization should \ndetermine if and how requirements for backup are fulfilled when using the information backup service \nprovided as part of the cloud service.\nThe retention period for essential business information should be determined, taking into account \nany requirement for retention of archive copies. The organization should consider the deletion of \ninformation (see 8.10) in storage media used for backup once the information’s retention period expires \nand should take into consideration legislation and regulations.\nOther information\nFor further information on storage security including retention consideration, see ISO/IEC 27040.\n8.14\tRedundancy of information processing facilities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Continuity\n#Asset_management\n#Protection\n#Resilience\nControl\nInformation processing facilities should be implemented with redundancy sufficient to meet availability \nrequirements.\nPurpose\nTo ensure the continuous operation of information processing facilities.\nGuidance\nThe organization should identify requirements for the availability of business services and information \nsystems. The organization should design and implement systems architecture with appropriate \nredundancy to meet these requirements.\nRedundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing facilities in part or in their \nentirety (i.e. spare components or having two of everything). The organization should plan and \nimplement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities. \nThe procedures should establish if the redundant components and processing activities are always \n\t\n\n\n\n102\n\nactivated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually activated. The redundant components \nand information processing facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones.\nMechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure in the information processing \nfacilities, enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the \ninformation processing facilities are repaired or replaced.\nThe organization should consider the following when implementing redundant systems:\na)\t contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical information processing facilities \nsuch as internet service providers;\nb)\t using redundant networks;\nc)\t\nusing two geographically separate data centres with mirrored systems;\nd)\t using physically redundant power supplies or sources;\ne)\t using multiple parallel instances of software components, with automatic load balancing between \nthem (between instances in the same data centre or in different data centres);\nf)\t\nhaving duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memories) or in networks (e.g. \nfirewalls, routers, switches).\nWhere applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information systems should be tested to \nensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended.\nOther information\nThere is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness for business continuity (see 5.30) \nespecially if short recovery times are required. Many of the redundancy measures can be part of the \nICT continuity strategies and solutions.\nThe implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity (e.g. processes of copying \ndata to duplicated components can introduce errors) or confidentiality (e.g. weak security control of \nduplicated components can lead to compromise) of information and information systems, which need \nto be considered when designing information systems.\nRedundancy in information processing facilities does not usually address application unavailability due \nto faults within an application.\nWith the use of public cloud computing, it is possible to have multiple live versions of information \nprocessing facilities, existing in multiple separate physical locations with automatic failover and load \nbalancing between them.\nSome of the technologies and techniques for providing redundancy and automatic fail-over in the \ncontext of cloud services are discussed in ISO/IEC TS 23167.\n8.15\tLogging\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Detective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Detect\n#Information_securi\nty_event_management\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nLogs that record activities, exceptions, faults and other relevant events should be produced, stored, \nprotected and analysed.\n\n\n103\n\nPurpose\nTo record events, generate evidence, ensure the integrity of log information, prevent against \nunauthorized access, identify information security events that can lead to an information security \nincident and to support investigations.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should determine the purpose for which logs are created, what data is collected and \nlogged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data. This should be \ndocumented in a topic-specific policy on logging.\nEvent logs should include for each event, as applicable:\na)\t user IDs;\nb)\t system activities;\nc)\t\ndates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);\nd)\t device identity, system identifier and location;\ne)\t network addresses and protocols.\nThe following events should be considered for logging:\na)\t successful and rejected system access attempts;\nb)\t successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;\nc)\t\nchanges to system configuration;\nd)\t use of privileges;\ne)\t use of utility programs and applications;\nf)\t\nfiles accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files;\ng)\t alarms raised by the access control system;\nh)\t activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection \nsystems;\ni)\t\ncreation, modification or deletion of identities;\nj)\t\ntransactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or \nproduct provided or run by a third party.\nIt is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation \nof logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident.\nProtection of logs\nUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate \nlogs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing \nfacilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain \naccountability for the privileged users.\nControls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational \nproblems with the logging facility including:\na)\t alterations to the message types that are recorded;\n\t\n\n\n\n104\n\nb)\t log files being edited or deleted;\nc)\t\nfailure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log \nfile is exceeded.\nFor protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing, \nrecording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.\nSome audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or \nrequirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28).\nWhere the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or \ntroubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see \n8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization \nname, before sending to the vendor.\nEvent logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy \nprotection measures should be taken (see 5.34).\nLog analysis\nLog analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify \nunusual activity or anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.\nAnalysis of events should be performed by taking into account:\na)\t the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;\nb)\t determining the procedure of log analysis;\nc)\t\nthe required attributes of each security-related event;\nd)\t exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and \nevent management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware \nsignatures];\ne)\t known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and \nbehaviour [user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA)];\nf)\t\nresults of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and \nspecialized analysis tools);\ng)\t available threat intelligence.\nLog analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyse \nanomalous behaviour, which includes:\na)\t reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name \nsystem (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares];\nb)\t checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those \nassociated with botnet command and control servers;\nc)\t\nexamining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual \nactivity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);\nd)\t including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate \ndetection and incident analysis;\ne)\t correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.\n\n\n105\n\nSuspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or \nprobing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security \nincident management process, see 5.25).\nOther information\nSystem logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information \nsecurity monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes, \nthe use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered.\nEvent logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of \ngenerating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.\nA SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyse log information, \nand to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits. \nConfigurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and \ntesting of rules and development of use cases.\nPublic transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency \nsystems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log \ntampering.\nIn cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service \ncustomer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service \nbeing used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.\n8.16\tMonitoring activities\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Detective\n#Corrective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity #Availability\n#Detect #Respond\n#Information_securi\nty_event_management\n#Defence\nControl\nNetworks, systems and applications should be monitored for anomalous behaviour and appropriate \nactions taken to evaluate potential information security incidents.\nPurpose\nTo detect anomalous behaviour and potential information security incidents.\nGuidance\nThe monitoring scope and level should be determined in accordance with business and information \nsecurity requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations. Monitoring records \nshould be maintained for defined retention periods.\nThe following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring system:\na)\t outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic;\nb)\t access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system, critical applications, etc.;\nc)\t\ncritical or admin level system and network configuration files;\nd)\t logs from security tools [e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filters, firewalls, \ndata leakage prevention];\ne)\t event logs relating to system and network activity;\n\t\n\n\n\n106\n\nf)\t\nchecking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the system and that it has not been \ntampered with (e.g. by recompilation to add additional unwanted code);\ng)\t use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and their performance.\nThe organization should establish a baseline of normal behaviour and monitor against this baseline for \nanomalies. When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:\na)\t reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;\nb)\t usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.\nThe monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous \nbehaviour, such as:\na)\t unplanned termination of processes or applications;\nb)\t activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses \nor network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);\nc)\t\nknown attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);\nd)\t unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of \nstandard protocols);\ne)\t bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);\nf)\t\nunauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;\ng)\t unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;\nh)\t successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals \nand file systems);\ni)\t\nunusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.\nContinuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or \nin periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include \nthe ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow \nfor real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or \nnetwork or application behaviour patterns.\nAutomated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles, \nemail messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system \nshould be tuned and trained on the organization’s baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should \nbe dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential \nincidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert \nnotifications.\nAbnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following \nactivities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures \nshould be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in \norder to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should \nalso be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to \nreduce the number of future false positives.\nOther information\nSecurity monitoring can be enhanced by:\na)\t leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7);\nb)\t leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities;\n\n\n107\n\nc)\t\nusing blocklists or allowlists;\nd)\t undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration \ntesting, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these \nassessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behaviour;\ne)\t using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behaviour;\nf)\t\nleveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.\nMonitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection \nsystems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network \nactivities.\nMonitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices \nunder the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service \nattacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external \ndevice, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller. The organization \nshould therefore employ technologies to monitor for anomalous communications and take such action \nas necessary.\n8.17\tClock synchronization\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Detective\n#Integrity\n#Protect #Detect\n#Information_securi\nty_event_management\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nThe clocks of information processing systems used by the organization should be synchronized to \napproved time sources.\nPurpose\nTo enable the correlation and analysis of security-related events and other recorded data, and to \nsupport investigations into information security incidents.\nGuidance\nExternal and internal requirements for time representation, reliable synchronization and accuracy \nshould be documented and implemented. Such requirements can be from legal, statutory, regulatory, \ncontractual, standards and internal monitoring needs. A standard reference time for use within the \norganization should be defined and considered for all systems, including building management systems, \nentry and exit systems and others that can be used to aid investigations.\nA clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock or global positioning system (GPS) \nshould be used as the reference clock for logging systems; a consistent, trusted date and time source to \nensure accurate time-stamps. Protocols such as network time protocol (NTP) or precision time protocol \n(PTP) should be used to keep all networked systems in synchronization with a reference clock.\nThe organization can use two external time sources at the same time in order to improve the reliability \nof external clocks, and appropriately manage any variance.\nClock synchronization can be difficult when using multiple cloud services or when using both cloud \nand on-premises services. In this case, the clock of each service should be monitored and the difference \nrecorded in order to mitigate risks arising from discrepancies.\n\t\n\n\n\n108\n\nOther information\nThe correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of event logs, which can \nbe required for investigations or as evidence in legal and disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs can \nhinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence.\n8.18\tUse of privileged utility programs\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Secure_configura\ntion\n#Application_security\n#Protection\nControl\nThe use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and application controls should be \nrestricted and tightly controlled.\nPurpose\nTo ensure the use of utility programs does not harm system and application controls for information \nsecurity.\nGuidance\nThe following guidelines for the use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and \napplication controls should be considered:\na)\t limitation of the use of utility programs to the minimum practical number of trusted, authorized \nusers (see 8.2);\nb)\t use of identification, authentication and authorization procedures for utility programs, including \nunique identification of the person who uses the utility program;\nc)\t\ndefining and documenting of authorization levels for utility programs;\nd)\t authorization for ad hoc use of utility programs;\ne)\t not making utility programs available to users who have access to applications on systems where \nsegregation of duties is required;\nf)\t\nremoving or disabling all unnecessary utility programs;\ng)\t at a minimum, logical segregation of utility programs from application software.

Software \npatches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities \n(see 8.8 and 8.19).\nComputer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs \nusing modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid \nunauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities.\nVendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported \nby the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The \norganization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software. Open source software used \nin operational systems should be maintained to the latest appropriate release of the software. Over \ntime, open source code can cease to be maintained but is still available in an open source software \nrepository. The organization should also consider the risks of relying on unmaintained open source \nsoftware when used in operational systems.\n\t\n\n\n\n110\n\nWhen suppliers are involved in installing or updating software, physical or logical access should \nonly be given when necessary and with appropriate authorization. The supplier’s activities should be \nmonitored (see 5.22).\nThe organization should define and enforce strict rules on which types of software users can install.\nThe principle of least privilege should be applied to software installation on operational systems. \nThe organization should identify what types of software installations are permitted (e.g. updates and \nsecurity patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g. software \nthat is only for personal use and software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious \nis unknown or suspect).

Additional controls can also be required to maintain \nthe availability of the network services and computers connected to the network;\nf)\t\nappropriately logging and monitoring to enable recording and detection of actions that can affect, \nor are relevant to, information security (see 8.16 and 8.15);\ng)\t closely coordinating network management activities both to optimize the service to the \norganization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing \ninfrastructure;\n\n\n111\n\nh)\t authenticating systems on the network;\ni)\t\nrestricting and filtering systems connection to the network (e.g. using firewalls);\nj)\t\ndetecting, restricting and authenticating the connection of equipment and devices to the network;\nk)\t hardening of network devices;\nl)\t\nsegregating network administration channels from other network traffic;\nm)\t temporarily isolating critical subnetworks (e.g. with drawbridges) if the network is under attack;\nn)\t disabling vulnerable network protocols.\nThe organization should ensure that appropriate security controls are applied to the use of virtualized \nnetworks. Virtualized networks also cover software-defined networking (SDN, SD-WAN). Virtualized \nnetworks can be desirable from a security viewpoint, since they can permit logical separation of \ncommunication taking place over physical networks, particularly for systems and applications that are \nimplemented using distributed computing.\nOther information\nAdditional information on network security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27033 series.\nMore information concerning virtualized networks can be found in ISO/IEC TS 23167.\n8.21\tSecurity of network services\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nSecurity mechanisms, service levels and service requirements of network services should be identified, \nimplemented and monitored.\nPurpose\nTo ensure security in the use of network services.\nGuidance\nThe security measures necessary for particular services, such as security features, service levels and \nservice requirements, should be identified and implemented (by internal or external network service \nproviders). The organization should ensure that network service providers implement these measures.\nThe ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way should be \ndetermined and regularly monitored. The right to audit should be agreed between the organization \nand the provider. The organization should also consider third-party attestations provided by service \nproviders to demonstrate they maintain appropriate security measures.\nRules on the use of networks and network services should be formulated and implemented to cover:\na)\t the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;\nb)\t authentication requirements for accessing various network services;\nc)\t\nauthorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked \nservices;\n\t\n\n\n\n112\n\nd)\t network management and technological controls and procedures to protect access to network \nconnections and network services;\ne)\t the means used to access networks and network services [e.g. use of virtual private network (VPN) \nor wireless network];\nf)\t\ntime, location and other attributes of the user at the time of the access;\ng)\t monitoring of the use of network services.\nThe following security features of network services should be considered:\na)\t technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption and \nnetwork connection controls;\nb)\t technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in accordance \nwith the security and network connection rules;\nc)\t\ncaching (e.g. in a content delivery network) and its parameters that allow users to choose the use of \ncaching in accordance with performance, availability and confidentiality requirements;\nd)\t procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or applications, \nwhere necessary.\nOther information\nNetwork services include the provision of connections, private network services and managed network \nsecurity solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These services can range from \nsimple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.\nMore guidance on a framework for access management is given in ISO/IEC 29146.\n8.22\tSegregation of networks\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nGroups of information services, users and information systems should be segregated in the \norganization’s networks.\nPurpose\nTo split the network in security boundaries and to control traffic between them based on business \nneeds.\nGuidance\nThe organization should consider managing the security of large networks by dividing them into \nseparate network domains and separating them from the public network (i.e. internet). The domains \ncan be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop \ndomain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, \nfinance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational \nunits). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different \nlogical networks.\nThe perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed, \nit should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for \n\n\n113\n\nsegregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based \non an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance \nwith the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification \nof information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating \nsuitable gateway technology.\nWireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio \ncoverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive \nenvironments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and \nto segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in \naccordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access \nnetwork for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user \nendpoint devices compliant to the organization’s topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have \nat least the same restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest WiFi by \npersonnel.\nOther information\nNetworks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that \nrequire the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such \nextensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization’s information systems \nthat use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their \nsensitivity or criticality.\n8.23 Web filtering\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nAccess to external websites should be managed to reduce exposure to malicious content.\nPurpose\nTo protect systems from being compromised by malware and to prevent access to unauthorized web \nresources.\nGuidance\nThe organization should reduce the risks of its personnel accessing websites that contain illegal \ninformation or are known to contain viruses or phishing material. A technique for achieving this works \nby blocking the IP address or domain of the website(s) concerned. Some browsers and anti-malware \ntechnologies do this automatically or can be configured to do so.\nThe organization should identify the types of websites to which personnel should or should not have \naccess. The organization should consider blocking access to the following types of websites:\na)\t websites that have an information upload function unless permitted for valid business reasons;\nb)\t known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. those distributing malware or phishing contents);\nc)\t\ncommand and control servers;\nd)\t malicious website acquired from threat intelligence (see 5.7);\ne)\t websites sharing illegal content.\n\t\n\n\n\n114\n\nPrior to deploying this control, the organization should establish rules for safe and appropriate use \nof online resources, including any restriction to undesirable or inappropriate websites and web-based \napplications. The rules should be kept up-to-date.\nTraining should be given to personnel on the secure and appropriate use of online resources including \naccess to the web. The training should include the organization’s rules, contact point for raising security \nconcerns, and exception process when restricted web resources need to be accessed for legitimate \nbusiness reasons. Training should also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any \nbrowser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows the user to proceed.\nOther information\nWeb filtering can include a range of techniques including signatures, heuristics, list of acceptable \nwebsites or domains, list of prohibited websites or domains and bespoke configuration to help prevent \nmalicious software and other malicious activity from attacking the organization’s network and systems.\n8.24\tUse of cryptography\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity do\nmains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Secure_configuration\n#Protection\nControl\nRules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, should be defined \nand implemented.\nPurpose\nTo ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity or \nintegrity of information according to business and information security requirements, and taking into \nconsideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to cryptography.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nWhen using cryptography, the following should be considered:\na)\t the topic-specific policy on cryptography defined by the organization, including the general \nprinciples for the protection of information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is \nnecessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and \nto avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;\nb)\t identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and \nconsequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;\nc)\t\nthe use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or \nstorage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;\nd)\t the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of \ncryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or \ndamaged keys;\ne)\t roles and responsibilities for:\n1)\t the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;\n\n\n115\n\n2)\t the key management, including key generation (see 8.24);\nf)\t\nthe standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic \nsolutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization;\ng)\t the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware \ndetection or content filtering).\nWhen implementing the organization’s rules for effective use of cryptography, the regulations and \nnational restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world \nshould be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information \n(see 5.31).\nThe contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services \n(e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response \ntimes for the provision of services (see 5.22).\nKey management\nAppropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, \ndistributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.\nA key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and secure \nmethods for:\na)\t generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;\nb)\t issuing and obtaining public key certificates;\nc)\t\ndistributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received;\nd)\t storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;\ne)\t changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done;\nf)\t\ndealing with compromised keys;\ng)\t revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised \nor when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)];\nh)\t recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;\ni)\t\nbacking up or archiving keys;\nj)\t\ndestroying keys;\nk)\t logging and auditing of key management related activities;\nl)\t\nsetting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of \ntime according to the organization's rules on key management;\nm)\t handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g. encrypted information can be \nrequired to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).\nAll cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private \nkeys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store \nand archive keys should be physically protected.\nIn addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.\n\t\n\n\n\n116\n\nOther information\nThe authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key management processes using \ncertificate authorities and public key certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using \ntechnologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.\nCryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example:\na)\t confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either \nstored or transmitted;\nb)\t integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the \nauthenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using algorithms \nfor the purpose of file integrity checking;\nc)\t\nnon-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of an event or action;\nd)\t authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities \nrequesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources.\nThe ISO/IEC 11770 series provides further information on key management.\n8.25\tSecure development life cycle\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nRules for the secure development of software and systems should be established and applied.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information security is designed and implemented within the secure development life cycle \nof software and systems.\nGuidance\nSecure development is a requirement to build up a secure service, architecture, software and system. \nTo achieve this, the following aspects should be considered:\na)\t separation of development, test and production environments (see 8.31);\nb)\t guidance on the security in the software development life cycle:\n1)\t security in the software development methodology (see 8.28 and 8.27);\n2)\t secure coding guidelines for each programming language used (see 8.28);\nc)\t\nsecurity requirements in the specification and design phase (see 5.8);\nd)\t security checkpoints in projects (see 5.8);\ne)\t system and security testing, such as regression testing, code scan and penetration tests (see 8.29);\nf)\t\nsecure repositories for source code and configuration (see 8.4 and 8.9);\ng)\t security in the version control (see 8.32);\n\n\n117\n\nh)\t required application security knowledge and training (see 8.28);\ni)\t\ndevelopers’ capability for preventing, finding and fixing vulnerabilities (see 8.28);\nj)\t\nlicensing requirements and alternatives to ensure cost-effective solutions while avoiding future \nlicensing issues (See 5.32).\nIf development is outsourced, the organization should obtain assurance that the supplier complies with \nthe organization’s rules for secure development (see 8.30).\nOther information\nDevelopment can also take place inside applications, such as office applications, scripting, browsers and \ndatabases.\n8.26\tApplication security requirements\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\n#Defence\nControl\nInformation security requirements should be identified, specified and approved when developing or \nacquiring applications.\nPurpose\nTo ensure all information security requirements are identified and addressed when developing or \nacquiring applications.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nApplication security requirements should be identified and specified. These requirements are usually \ndetermined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of \ninformation security specialists.\nApplication security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the \napplication.\nApplication security requirements should include, as applicable:\na)\t level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)];\nb)\t identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application;\nc)\t\nneed for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application;\nd)\t resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer \noverflow or structured query language (SQL) injections];\ne)\t legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated, \nprocessed, completed or stored;\nf)\t\nneed for privacy associated with all parties involved;\ng)\t the protection requirements of any confidential information;\nh)\t protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest;\n\t\n\n\n\n118\n\ni)\t\nneed to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties;\nj)\t\ninput controls, including integrity checks and input validation;\nk)\t automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals);\nl)\t\noutput controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization;\nm)\t restrictions around content of \"free-text\" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of \nconfidential data (e.g. personal data);\nn)\t requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring, \nnonrepudiation requirements;\no)\t requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or \ndata leakage detection systems);\np)\t error message handling.\nTransactional services\nAdditionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner, \nthe following should be considered when identifying information security requirements:\na)\t the level of trust each party requires in each other’s claimed identity;\nb)\t the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the \nmechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital \nsignatures);\nc)\t\nauthorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key \ntransactional documents;\nd)\t confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation \n(e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes);\ne)\t the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and \nconfirmation of receipts);\nf)\t\nrequirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;\ng)\t insurance and other contractual requirements.\nElectronic ordering and payment applications\nAdditionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should be \nconsidered:\na)\t requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information;\nb)\t the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer;\nc)\t\navoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;\nd)\t storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform \nexisting on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media \ndirectly accessible from the internet);\ne)\t where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital \nsignatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end-\nto-end certificate or signature management process.\n\n\n119\n\nSeveral of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24), \ntaking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography \nlegislation).\nOther information\nApplications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent \nactivities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, mis-\nrouting, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay. Therefore, detailed risk assessments \nand careful determination of controls are indispensable. Controls required often include cryptographic \nmethods for authentication and securing data transfer.\nFurther information on application security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27034 series.\n8.27\tSecure system architecture and engineering principles\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nPrinciples for engineering secure systems should be established, documented, maintained and applied \nto any information system development activities.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information systems are securely designed, implemented and operated within the \ndevelopment life cycle.\nGuidance\nSecurity engineering principles should be established, documented and applied to information \nsystem engineering activities. Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data, \napplications and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks and the design \nshould be reviewed against known attack patterns.\nSecure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session \ncontrol and data validation and sanitisation.\nSecure system engineering principles should include analysis of:\na)\t the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified \nthreats;\nb)\t the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events;\nc)\t\nspecific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive \ninformation, integrity checking and digitally signing information);\nd)\t where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture \nand the technical infrastructure);\ne)\t how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integrated \nset of controls.\nSecurity engineering principles should take account of:\na)\t the need to integrate with a security architecture;\n\t\n\n\n\n120\n\nb)\t technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access \nmanagement (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management];\nc)\t\ncapability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology;\nd)\t cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;\ne)\t current good practices.\nSecure system engineering should involve:\na)\t the use of security architecture principles, such as “security by design”, “defence in depth”, \n“security by default”, “default deny”, “fail securely”, “distrust input from external applications”, \n“security in deployment”, “assume breach”, \"least privilege\", “usability and manageability” and \n“least functionality”;\nb)\t a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure \nsecurity controls are specified and meet security requirements;\nc)\t\ndocumentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet \nrequirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements);\nd)\t hardening of systems.\nThe organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:\na)\t assuming the organization’s information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on \nnetwork perimeter security alone;\nb)\t employing a “never trust and always verify” approach for access to information systems;\nc)\t\nensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end;\nd)\t verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network, \neven if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting \nanything inside or outside its perimeters);\ne)\t using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes \nauthenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual \ninformation such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the \nuser endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12);\nf)\t\nalways authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information \nsystems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities \n(5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing \nstrong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5).\nThe established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced \ndevelopment of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the \norganization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure \nthat suppliers’ security engineering practices align with the organization’s needs.\nThe security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly \nreviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within \nthe engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to-\ndate in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the \ntechnologies and solutions being applied.\n\n\n121\n\nOther information\nSecure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques, \nsuch as:\n—\t fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;\n—\t segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);\n—\t tamper resistance.\nSecure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on \nthe same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that \ninstance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data.\nTamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether \nphysical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that \nthere is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the \nsuccessful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).\n8.28\tSecure coding\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity do\nmains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_network_\nsecurity\n#Protection\nControl\nSecure coding principles should be applied to software development.\nPurpose\nTo ensure software is written securely thereby reducing the number of potential information security \nvulnerabilities in the software.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should establish organization-wide processes to provide good governance for secure \ncoding. A minimum secure baseline should be established and applied. Additionally, such processes \nand governance should be extended to cover software components from third parties and open source \nsoftware.\nThe organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software \nvulnerabilities to guide the organization’s secure coding principles through continual improvement and \nlearning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the \nfast-changing threat landscape.\nPlanning and before coding\nSecure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These \nprinciples should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products \nand services supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites before coding should \ninclude:\na)\t organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both \nin-house and outsourced code developments;\nb)\t common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities;\n\t\n\n\n\n122\n\nc)\t\nconfiguring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce \nthe creation of secure code;\nd)\t following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and execution environments as \napplicable;\ne)\t maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);\nf)\t\nqualification of developers in writing secure code;\ng)\t secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;\nh)\t secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;\ni)\t\nuse of controlled environments for development.\nDuring coding\nConsiderations during coding should include:\na)\t secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used;\nb)\t using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming, refactoring, peer review, \nsecurity iterations and test-driven development;\nc)\t\nusing structured programming techniques;\nd)\t documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow information security \nvulnerabilities to be exploited;\ne)\t prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved \ncode samples and unauthenticated web services).\nTesting should be conducted during and after development (see 8.29). Static application security testing \n(SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.\nBefore software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:\na)\t attack surface and the principle of least privilege;\nb)\t conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have \nbeen mitigated.\nReview and maintenance\nAfter code has been made operational:\na)\t updates should be securely packaged and deployed;\nb)\t reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8);\nc)\t\nerrors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to \nthe code as necessary;\nd)\t source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using \nconfiguration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and \nversion control).\nIf using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:\na)\t ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used \nand their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;\n\n\n123\n\nb)\t selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and \ncryptographic components;\nc)\t\nthe licence, security and history of external components;\nd)\t ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;\ne)\t sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.\nWhere a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:\na)\t the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;\nb)\t whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;\nc)\t\nthe possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;\nd)\t the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a \nresult of changes;\ne)\t compatibility with other software in use.\nOther information\nA guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamper-\nresistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for \ndata held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is \nexecuted on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its \ndata is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud \nservice where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access \nshould be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong \nauthentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in \nprinciple can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.\nApplication code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or \nmalicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For \nexample, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds \nbefore the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that \nperforms the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness.\nSome web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design \nand coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be \nmanipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.\nMore information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series.\n8.29\tSecurity testing in development and acceptance\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify\n#Application_security\n#Information_securi\nty_assurance\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nSecurity testing processes should be defined and implemented in the development life cycle.\n\t\n\n\n\n124\n\nPurpose\nTo validate if information security requirements are met when applications or code are deployed to the \nproduction environment.\nGuidance\nNew information systems, upgrades and new versions should be thoroughly tested and verified during \nthe development processes. Security testing should be an integral part of the testing for systems or \ncomponents.\nSecurity testing should be conducted against a set of requirements, which can be expressed as \nfunctional or non-functional. Security testing should include testing of:\na)\t security functions [e.g. user authentication (see 8.5), access restriction (see 8.3) and use of \ncryptography (see 8.24)];\nb)\t secure coding (see 8.28);\nc)\t\nsecure configurations (see 8.9, 8.20 and 8.22) including that of operating systems, firewalls and \nother security components.\nTest plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of testing should be in proportion to \nthe importance, nature of the system and the potential impact of the change being introduced. The test \nplan should include:\na)\t detailed schedule of activities and tests;\nb)\t inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions;\nc)\t\ncriteria to evaluate the results;\nd)\t decision for further actions as necessary.\nThe organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners, \nand should verify the remediation of security related defects.\nFor in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by the development team. \nIndependent acceptance testing should then be undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected \nand only as expected (see 5.8). The following should be considered:\na)\t performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing for security flaws, including un-\nanticipated inputs and conditions;\nb)\t performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure configurations and system vulnerabilities;\nc)\t\nperforming penetration testing to identify insecure code and design.\nFor outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition process should be followed. \nContracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements (see 5.20). Products \nand services should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition.\nTesting should be performed in a test environment that matches the target production environment \nas closely as possible to ensure that the system does not introduce vulnerabilities to the organization’s \nenvironment and that the tests are reliable (see 8.31).\nOther information\nMultiple test environments can be established, which can be used for different kinds of testing (e.g. \nfunctional and performance testing). These different environments can be virtual, with individual \nconfigurations to simulate a variety of operating environments.\n\n\n125\n\nTesting and monitoring of test environments, tools and technologies also needs to be considered to \nensure effective testing. The same considerations apply to monitoring of the monitoring systems \ndeployed in development, test and production settings. Judgement is needed, guided by the sensitivity \nof the systems and data, to determine how many layers of meta-testing are useful.\n8.30\tOutsourced development\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Identify #Protect \n#Detect\n#System_and_network_\nsecurity\n#Application_security\n#Supplier_relationships_\nsecurity\n#Governance_and_\nEcosystem\n#Protection\nControl\nThe organization should direct, monitor and review the activities related to outsourced system \ndevelopment.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information security measures required by the organization are implemented in outsourced \nsystem development.\nGuidance\nWhere system development is outsourced, the organization should communicate and agree \nrequirements and expectations, and continually monitor and review whether the delivery of outsourced \nwork meets these expectations. The following points should be considered across the organization’s \nentire external supply chain:\na)\t licensing agreements, code ownership and intellectual property rights related to the outsourced \ncontent (see 5.32);\nb)\t contractual requirements for secure design, coding and testing practices (see 8.25 to 8.29);\nc)\t\nprovision of the threat model to consider by external developers;\nd)\t acceptance testing for the quality and accuracy of the deliverables (see 8.29);\ne)\t provision of evidence that minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy capabilities are \nestablished (e.g. assurance reports);\nf)\t\nprovision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of \nmalicious content (both intentional and unintentional) upon delivery;\ng)\t provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of \nknown vulnerabilities;\nh)\t escrow agreements for the software source code (e.g. if the supplier goes out of business);\ni)\t\ncontractual right to audit development processes and controls;\nj)\t\nsecurity requirements for the development environment (see 8.31);\nk)\t taking consideration of applicable legislation (e.g. on protection of personal data).\nOther information\nFurther information on supplier relationships can be found in the ISO/IEC 27036 series.\n\t\n\n\n\n126\n\n8.31\tSeparation of development, test and production environments\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nDevelopment, testing and production environments should be separated and secured.\nPurpose\nTo protect the production environment and data from compromise by development and test activities.\nGuidance\nThe level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary \nto prevent production problems should be identified and implemented.\nThe following items should be considered:\na)\t adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different \ndomains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments);\nb)\t defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software \nfrom development to production status;\nc)\t\ntesting changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to \nbeing applied to production systems (see 8.29);\nd)\t not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and \napproved;\ne)\t compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from \nproduction systems when not required;\nf)\t\ndisplaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error;\ng)\t not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless \nequivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems.\nIn all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering:\na)\t patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders, \nintegrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries);\nb)\t secure configuration of systems and software;\nc)\t\ncontrol of access to the environments;\nd)\t monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\ne)\t secure monitoring of the environments;\nf)\t\ntaking backups of the environments.\nA single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without \nprior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights \nor through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed \nlogging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized \nchanges.\n\n\n127\n\nOther information\nWithout adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production \nsystems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment, \nsystem failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of \nconfidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable \nenvironment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to \nthe production environment.\nMeasures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing \nsegregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place.\nDevelopment and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information. \nDevelopment and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they \nshare the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments \nis therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production \nsoftware and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information).\nIn some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be \ndeliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled \nrollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can \noccur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live \ndeployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any \none time.\nSupporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33) \nare necessary.\nOrganizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when \nconducting end user training.\n8.32\tChange management\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#Application_security\n#System_and_net\nwork_security\n#Protection\nControl\nChanges to information processing facilities and information systems should be subject to change \nmanagement procedures.\nPurpose\nTo preserve information security when executing changes.\nGuidance\nIntroduction of new systems and major changes to existing systems should follow agreed rules and a \nformal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control and managed implementation. \nManagement responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all \nchanges.\nChange control procedures should be documented and enforced to ensure the confidentiality, integrity \nand availability of information in information processing facilities and information systems, for the \nentire system development life cycle from the early design stages through all subsequent maintenance \nefforts.\n\t\n\n\n\n128\n\nWherever practicable, change control procedures for ICT infrastructure and software should be \nintegrated.\nThe change control procedures should include:\na)\t planning and assessing the potential impact of changes considering all dependencies;\nb)\t authorization of changes;\nc)\t\ncommunicating changes to relevant interested parties;\nd)\t tests and acceptance of tests for the changes (see 8.29);\ne)\t implementation of changes including deployment plans;\nf)\t\nemergency and contingency considerations including fall-back procedures;\ng)\t maintaining records of changes that include all of the above;\nh)\t ensuring that operating documentation (see 5.37) and user procedures are changed as necessary \nto remain appropriate;\ni)\t\nensuring that ICT continuity plans and response and recovery procedures (see 5.30) are changed \nas necessary to remain appropriate.\nOther information\nInadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and information systems is a \ncommon cause of system or security failures. Changes to the production environment, especially when \ntransferring software from development to operational environment, can impact on the integrity and \navailability of applications.\nChanging software can impact the production environment and vice versa.\nGood practice includes the testing of ICT components in an environment segregated from both the \nproduction and development environments (see 8.31). This provides a means of having control over \nnew software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for testing \npurposes. This should include patches, service packs and other updates.\nProduction environment includes operating systems, databases and middleware platforms. The control \nshould be applied for changes of applications and infrastructures.\n8.33\tTest information\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Protect\n#Information_protection\n#Protection\nControl\nTest information should be appropriately selected, protected and managed.\nPurpose\nTo ensure relevance of testing and protection of operational information used for testing.\nGuidance\nTest information should be selected to ensure the reliability of tests results and the confidentiality of the \nrelevant operational information. Sensitive information (including personally identifiable information) \nshould not be copied into the development and testing environments (see 8.31).\n\n\n129\n\nThe following guidelines should be applied to protect the copies of operational information, when used \nfor testing purposes, whether the test environment is built in-house or on a cloud service:\na)\t applying the same access control procedures to test environments as those applied to operational \nenvironments;\nb)\t having a separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test environment;\nc)\t\nlogging the copying and use of operational information to provide an audit trail;\nd)\t protecting sensitive information by removal or masking (see 8.11) if used for testing;\ne)\t properly deleting (see 8.10) operational information from a test environment immediately after the \ntesting is complete to prevent unauthorized use of test information.\nTest information should be securely stored (to prevent tampering, which can otherwise lead to invalid \nresults) and only used for testing purposes.\nOther information\nSystem and acceptance testing can require substantial volumes of test information that are as close as \npossible to operational information.\n8.34\tProtection of information systems during audit testing\nControl type\nInformation\nsecurity properties\nCybersecurity\nconcepts\nOperational\ncapabilities\nSecurity domains\n#Preventive\n#Confidentiality\n#Integrity\n#Availability\n#Protect\n#System_and_network_\nsecurity\n#Information_protection\n#Governance_and_\nEcosystem #Protec\ntion\nControl\nAudit tests and other assurance activities involving assessment of operational systems should be \nplanned and agreed between the tester and appropriate management.\nPurpose\nTo minimize the impact of audit and other assurance activities on operational systems and business \nprocesses.\nGuidance\nThe following guidelines should be observed:\na)\t agreeing audit requests for access to systems and data with appropriate management;\nb)\t agreeing and controlling the scope of technical audit tests;\nc)\t\nlimiting audit tests to read-only access to software and data. If read-only access is not available to \nobtain the necessary information, executing the test by an experienced administrator who has the \nnecessary access rights on behalf of the auditor;\nd)\t if access is granted, establishing and verifying the security requirements (e.g. antivirus and \npatching) of the devices used for accessing the systems (e.g. laptops or tablets) before allowing the \naccess;\ne)\t only allowing access other than read-only for isolated copies of system files, deleting them when \nthe audit is completed, or giving them appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such \nfiles under audit documentation requirements;\n\t\n\n\n\n130\n\nf)\t\nidentifying and agreeing on requests for special or additional processing, such as running audit \ntools;\ng)\t running audit tests that can affect system availability outside business hours;\nh)\t monitoring and logging all access for audit and test purposes.\nOther information\nAudit tests and other assurance activities can also happen on development and test systems, where \nsuch tests can impact for example the integrity of code or lead to disclosure of any sensitive information \nheld in such environments.\n\n\n131\n\nAnnex A\n(informative)\n\nUsing attributes\nA.1\t General\nThis annex provides a table to demonstrate the use of attributes as a way of creating different views of \nthe controls.

\nof attributes proposed in this document and create their own attributes with different values to \naddress specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values assigned to each attribute can differ \nbetween organizations since organizations can have different views on the use or applicability of the \ncontrol or of the values associated to the attribute (when the values are specific to the context of the \norganization). The first step is to understand why an organizational-specific attribute is desirable. For \nexample, if an organization has constructed its risk treatment plans [see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)] \nbased on events, it can wish to associate a risk scenario attribute to each control in this document.\nTable A.2 (continued)\n\n\n141\n\nThe benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement \nrelated to risk treatment, which is to compare the controls determined through the process of risk \ntreatment (referred to as “necessary” controls), with those in ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are \nissued from in this document) to ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.\nOnce the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine the attribute values. For \nexample, the organization might identify 9 events:\n1)\t loss or theft of mobile device;\n2)\t loss or theft from organization’s premises;\n3)\t force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;\n4)\t failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;\n5)\t fraud;\n6)\t hacking;\n7)\t disclosure;\n8)\t breach of the law;\n9)\t social engineering.\nThe second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers to each event (e.g. E1, E2, ..., E9).\nThe third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names from this document into a spreadsheet \nor database and associate the attribute values with each control, remembering that each control can \nhave more than one attribute value.\nThe final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to extract the required information.\nOther examples of organizational attributes (and possible values) include:\na)\t maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity models);\nb)\t implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented, fully implemented);\nc)\t\npriority (1, 2, 3, etc.);\nd)\t organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top management, etc.);\ne)\t events;\nf)\t\nassets involved;\ne)\t build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different steps of the service life cycle;\ng)\t other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning from.\n\t\n\n\n\n142\n\nAnnex B\n(informative)\n\nCorrespondence of ISO/IEC 27002:2022 (this document) with \nISO/IEC 27002:2013\nThe purpose of this annex is to provide backwards compatibility with ISO/IEC 27002:2013 for \norganizations that are currently using that standard and now wish to transition to this edition.\nTable B.1 provides the correspondence of the controls specified in Clauses 5 to 8 with those in \nISO/IEC 27002:2013.\nTable B.1 — Correspondence between controls in this document and controls in \nISO/IEC 27002:2013\nISO/\nIEC 27002:2022

    "Introduction",
    "0.1 Background and context",
    "This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It is to be used as a reference for ",
    "determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information ",
    "security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance ",
    "document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security ",
    "controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-",
    "specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific ",
    "information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than ",
    "those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.",
    "Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) ",
    "create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic, ",
    "physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).",
    "The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas ",
    "and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information ",
    "and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural, ",
    "accidental or deliberate.",
    "Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules, ",
    "processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its ",
    "specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review ",
    "and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a ",
    "holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and ",
    "implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a ",
    "coherent management system.",
    "Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be ",
    "secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that ",
    "can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate ",
    "management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place ",
    "requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.",
    "A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require ",
    "participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject ",
    "matter experts can also be needed.",
    "A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the ",
    "organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated ",
    "assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the ",
    "organization to achieve the stated business objectives.",
    "0.2 Information security requirements",
    "It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three ",
    "main sources of information security requirements:",
    "a)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business ",
    "strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-",
    "specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to ",
    "ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;",
    "b)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its ",
    "interested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-",
    "cultural environment;",
    "vii",
    "",
    "",
    "c)\t",
    "the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of ",
    "information that an organization has developed to support its operations.",
    "0.3 Controls",
    "A control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document ",
    "are controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example, ",
    "can only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk. ",
    "Moreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document ",
    "provides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security ",
    "controls derived from internationally recognized best practices.",
    "0.4 Determining controls",
    "Determining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with ",
    "a clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk ",
    "acceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The ",
    "determination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international ",
    "legislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls ",
    "interact with one another to provide defence in depth.",
    "The organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such ",
    "controls, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and ",
    "operate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions ",
    "regarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of ",
    "competing requirements for resources.",
    "There should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential ",
    "resulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a ",
    "risk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for ",
    "managing information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect ",
    "against these risks.",
    "Some of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security ",
    "management and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining ",
    "controls and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.",
    "0.5 Developing organization-specific guidelines",
    "This document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines. ",
    "Not all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional ",
    "controls and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs ",
    "of the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing ",
    "additional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document ",
    "for future reference.",
    "0.6 Life cycle considerations",
    "Information has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary ",
    "throughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is ",
    "not significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information ",
    "security remains important to some extent at all stages.",
    "Information systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which ",
    "they are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and ",
    "eventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every ",
    "stage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to ",
    "improve security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from ",
    "incidents.",

    "0.7 Related International Standards",
    "While this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are ",
    "commonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC 27000 family ",
    "provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing ",
    "information security.",
    "Refer to ISO/IEC 27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents. ",
    "ISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000 ",
    "family of documents, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.",
    "There are sector-specific standards that have additional controls which aim at addressing specific ",
    "areas (e.g. ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud services, ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC 27019 for energy, ",
    "ISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are ",

    "Since attributes are used to create different views of controls, organizations can discard the examples ",
    "of attributes proposed in this document and create their own attributes with different values to ",
    "address specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values assigned to each attribute can differ ",
    "between organizations since organizations can have different views on the use or applicability of the ",
    "control or of the values associated to the attribute (when the values are specific to the context of the ",
    "organization). The first step is to understand why an organizational-specific attribute is desirable. For ",
    "example, if an organization has constructed its risk treatment plans [see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)] ",
    "based on events, it can wish to associate a risk scenario attribute to each control in this document.",
    "Table A.2 (continued)",
    "",
    "",
    "141",
    "",
    "The benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement ",
    "related to risk treatment, which is to compare the controls determined through the process of risk ",
    "treatment (referred to as “necessary” controls), with those in ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are ",
    "issued from in this document) to ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.",
    "Once the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine the attribute values. For ",
    "example, the organization might identify 9 events:",
    "1)\t loss or theft of mobile device;",
    "2)\t loss or theft from organization’s premises;",
    "3)\t force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;",
    "4)\t failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;",
    "5)\t fraud;",
    "6)\t hacking;",
    "7)\t disclosure;",
    "8)\t breach of the law;",
    "9)\t social engineering.",
    "The second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers to each event (e.g. E1, E2, ..., E9).",
    "The third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names from this document into a spreadsheet ",
    "or database and associate the attribute values with each control, remembering that each control can ",
    "have more than one attribute value.",
    "The final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to extract the required information.",
    "Other examples of organizational attributes (and possible values) include:",
    "a)\t maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity models);",
    "b)\t implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented, fully implemented);",
    "c)\t",
    "priority (1, 2, 3, etc.);",
    "d)\t organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top management, etc.);",
    "e)\t events;",
    "f)\t",
    "assets involved;",
    "e)\t build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different steps of the service life cycle;",
    "g)\t other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning from.",

        "0.1 Background and context",
        "This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It is to be used as a reference for ",
        "determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information ",
        "security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance ",
        "document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security ",
        "controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-",
        "specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific ",
        "information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than ",
        "those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.",
        "Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) ",
        "create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic, ",
        "physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).",
        "The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas ",
        "and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information ",
        "and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural, ",
        "accidental or deliberate.",
        "Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules, ",
        "processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its ",
        "specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review ",
        "and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a ",
        "holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and ",
        "implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a ",
        "coherent management system.",
        "Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be ",
        "secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that ",
        "can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate ",
        "management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place ",
        "requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.",
        "A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require ",
        "participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject ",
        "matter experts can also be needed.",
        "A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the ",
        "organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated ",
        "assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the ",
        "organization to achieve the stated business objectives.",
        "0.2 Information security requirements",
        "It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three ",
        "main sources of information security requirements:",
        "a)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business ",
        "strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-",
        "specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to ",
        "ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;",
        "b)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its ",
