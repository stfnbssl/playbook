Control
Allocation and management of authentication information should be controlled by a management 
process, including advising personnel on the appropriate handling of authentication information.
Purpose
To ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of authentication processes.
Guidance
Allocation of authentication information
The allocation and management process should ensure that:
a)	 personal passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) generated automatically during 
enrolment processes as temporary secret authentication information are non-guessable and unique 
for each person, and that users are required to change them after the first use;
b)	 procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or 
temporary authentication information;
c)	
authentication information, including temporary authentication information, is transmitted 
to users in a secure manner (e.g. over an authenticated and protected channel) and the use of 
unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages for this purpose is avoided;
d)	 users acknowledge receipt of authentication information;
e)	 default authentication information as predefined or provided by vendors is changed immediately 
following installation of systems or software;
f)	
records of significant events concerning allocation and management of authentication information 
are kept and their confidentiality is granted, and that the record-keeping method is approved (e.g. 
by using an approved password vault tool).
User responsibilities
Any person having access to or using authentication information should be advised to ensure that:
a)	 secret authentication information such as passwords are kept confidential. Personal secret 
authentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used 
in the context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities are solely 
shared with authorized persons;
b)	 affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of 
or any other indication of a compromise;
c)	
when passwords are used as authentication information, strong passwords according to best 
practice recommendations are selected, for example:
