ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
The following guidelines should be applied to protect the copies of operational information, when used 
for testing purposes, whether the test environment is built in-house or on a cloud service:
a)	 applying the same access control procedures to test environments as those applied to operational 
environments;
b)	 having a separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test environment;
c)	
logging the copying and use of operational information to provide an audit trail;
d)	 protecting sensitive information by removal or masking (see 8.11) if used for testing;
e)	 properly deleting (see 8.10) operational information from a test environment immediately after the 
testing is complete to prevent unauthorized use of test information.
Test information should be securely stored (to prevent tampering, which can otherwise lead to invalid 
results) and only used for testing purposes.
Other information
System and acceptance testing can require substantial volumes of test information that are as close as 
possible to operational information.

Control
Audit tests and other assurance activities involving assessment of operational systems should be 
planned and agreed between the tester and appropriate management.
Purpose
To minimize the impact of audit and other assurance activities on operational systems and business 
processes.
Guidance
The following guidelines should be observed:
a)	 agreeing audit requests for access to systems and data with appropriate management;
b)	 agreeing and controlling the scope of technical audit tests;
c)	
limiting audit tests to read-only access to software and data. If read-only access is not available to 
obtain the necessary information, executing the test by an experienced administrator who has the 
necessary access rights on behalf of the auditor;
d)	 if access is granted, establishing and verifying the security requirements (e.g. antivirus and 
patching) of the devices used for accessing the systems (e.g. laptops or tablets) before allowing the 
access;
e)	 only allowing access other than read-only for isolated copies of system files, deleting them when 
the audit is completed, or giving them appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such 
files under audit documentation requirements;
