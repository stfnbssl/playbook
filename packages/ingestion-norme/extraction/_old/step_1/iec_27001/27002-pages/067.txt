Control
Operating procedures for information processing facilities should be documented and made available 
to personnel who need them.
Purpose
To ensure the correct and secure operation of information processing facilities.
Guidance
Documented procedures should be prepared for the organization’s operational activities associated 
with information security, for example:
a)	 when the activity needs to be performed in the same way by many people;
b)	 when the activity is performed rarely and when next performed the procedure is likely to have 
been forgotten;
c)	
when the activity is new and presents a risk if not performed correctly;
d)	 prior to handing over the activity to new personnel.
The operating procedures should specify:
a)	 the responsible individuals;
b)	 the secure installation and configuration of systems;
c)	
processing and handling of information, both automated and manual;
d)	 backup (see 8.13) and resilience;
e)	 scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems;
f)	
instructions for handling errors or other exceptional conditions [e.g. restrictions on the use of 
utility programs (see 8.18)], which can arise during job execution;
g)	 support and escalation contacts including external support contacts in the event of unexpected 
operational or technical difficulties;
h)	 storage media handling instructions (see 7.10 and 7.14);
i)	
system restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure;
