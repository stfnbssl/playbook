f)	
restrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic 
forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);
g)	 advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant 
messages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by 
unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;
h)	 advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or 
services, namely:
1)	 unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;
2)	 deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers.
Physical storage media transfer
When transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should 
also include:
a)	 responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;
b)	 ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;
c)	
packaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit 
and in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications, for example protecting against any 
environmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as 
exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for 
packaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes);
d)	 a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;
e)	 courier identification standards;
f)	
depending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use 
tamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);
g)	 procedures to verify the identification of couriers;
h)	 approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the 
classification of the information;
i)	
keeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as 
recording the list of authorised recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and 
receipt at the destination.
Verbal transfer
To protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded 
that they should:
a)	 not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication 
channels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;
b)	 not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages 
since these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored 
incorrectly as a result of misdialling;
c)	
be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;
