A.2	 Organizational views
Since attributes are used to create different views of controls, organizations can discard the examples 
of attributes proposed in this document and create their own attributes with different values to 
address specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values assigned to each attribute can differ 
between organizations since organizations can have different views on the use or applicability of the 
control or of the values associated to the attribute (when the values are specific to the context of the 
organization). The first step is to understand why an organizational-specific attribute is desirable. For 
example, if an organization has constructed its risk treatment plans [see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)] 
based on events, it can wish to associate a risk scenario attribute to each control in this document.
