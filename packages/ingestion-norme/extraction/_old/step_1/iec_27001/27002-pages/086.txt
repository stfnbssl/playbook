ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Permanent installation of equipment outside the organization’s premises [such as antennas and 
automated teller machines (ATMs)] can be subject to higher risk of damage, theft or eavesdropping. 
These risks can vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining 
the most appropriate measures. The following guidelines should be considered when siting this 
equipment outside of the organization’s premises:
a)	 physical security monitoring (see 7.4);
b)	 protecting against physical and environmental threats (see 7.5);
c)	
physical access and tamper proofing controls;
d)	 logical access controls.
Other information
More information about other aspects of protecting information storing and processing equipment and 
user endpoint devices can be found in 8.1 and 6.7.

Storage media should be managed through their life cycle of acquisition, use, transportation and 
disposal in accordance with the organization’s classification scheme and handling requirements.
Purpose
To ensure only authorized disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of information on storage 
media.
Guidance
Removable storage media
The following guidelines for the management of removable storage media should be considered:
a)	 establishing a topic-specific policy on the management of removable storage media and 
communicating such topic- specific policy to anyone who uses or handles removable storage media;
b)	 where necessary and practical, requiring authorization for storage media to be removed from the 
organization and keeping a record of such removals in order to maintain an audit trail;
c)	
storing all storage media in a safe, secure environment according to their information classification 
and protecting them against environmental threats (such as heat, moisture, humidity, electronic 
field or ageing), in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications;
d)	 if information confidentiality or integrity are important considerations, using cryptographic 
techniques to protect information on removable storage media;
e)	 to mitigate the risk of storage media degrading while stored information is still needed, transferring 
the information to fresh storage media before becoming unreadable;
f)	
storing multiple copies of valuable information on separate storage media to further reduce the 
risk of coincidental information damage or loss;
