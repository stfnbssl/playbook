coordinating with internal and external parties such as authorities, external interest groups and

for other organizations;

performing post-incident analysis to identify root cause. Ensure it is documented and communicated 
according to defined procedures (see 5.27);

Control
Knowledge gained from information security incidents should be used to strengthen and improve the 
information security controls.
Purpose
To reduce the likelihood or consequences of future incidents.
Guidance
The organization should establish procedures to quantify and monitor the types, volumes and costs of 
information security incidents.
The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to:
a)	 enhance the incident management plan including incident scenarios and procedures (see 5.24);
b)	 identify recurring or serious incidents and their causes to update the organization’s information 
security risk assessment and determine and implement necessary additional controls to reduce 
the likelihood or consequences of future similar incidents. Mechanisms to enable that include 
collecting, quantifying and monitoring information about incident types, volumes and costs;
c)	
enhance user awareness and training (see 6.3) by providing examples of what can happen, how to 
respond to such incidents and how to avoid them in the future.
Other information
