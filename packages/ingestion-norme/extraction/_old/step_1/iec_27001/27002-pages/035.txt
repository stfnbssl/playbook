ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Purpose
To maintain the security of information transferred within an organization and with any external 
interested party.
Guidance
General
The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on information transfer 
to all relevant interested parties. Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit 
should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between 
the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be 
established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10).
Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and 
verbal transfer.
For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:
a)	 controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access, 
copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access 
control commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls 
that are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see 
8.24);
b)	 controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for 
information while in transit;
c)	
identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk 
owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;
d)	 responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical 
storage media or data;
e)	 use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning 
of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see 
5.13);
f)	
reliability and availability of the transfer service;
g)	 the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10);
h)	 retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;
NOTE	
Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.
i)	
the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements 
(see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic 
signatures).
Electronic transfer
Rules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic 
communication facilities for information transfer:
a)	 detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic 
communications (see 8.7);
b)	 protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;
c)	
prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or 
number;
