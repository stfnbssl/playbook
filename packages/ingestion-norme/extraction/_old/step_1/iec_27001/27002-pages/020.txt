ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Guidance
At the highest level, the organization should define an “information security policy” which is approved 
by top management and which sets out the organization’s approach to managing its information 
security.
The information security policy should take into consideration requirements derived from:
a)	 business strategy and requirements;
b)	 regulations, legislation and contracts;
c)	
the current and projected information security risks and threats.
The information security policy should contain statements concerning:
a)	 definition of information security;
b)	 information security objectives or the framework for setting information security objectives;
c)	
principles to guide all activities relating to information security;
d)	 commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information security;
e)	 commitment to continual improvement of the information security management system;
f)	
assignment of responsibilities for information security management to defined roles;
g)	 procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions.
Top management should approve any changes to the information security policy.
At a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies as 
needed, to further mandate the implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific policies 
are typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to 
cover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the 
information security policy of the organization.
Examples of such topics include:
a)	 access control;
b)	 physical and environmental security;
c)	
asset management;
d)	 information transfer;
e)	 secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;
f)	
networking security;
g)	 information security incident management;
h)	 backup;
i)	
cryptography and key management;
j)	
information classification and handling;
k)	 management of technical vulnerabilities;
l)	
secure development.
