ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
The benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement 
related to risk treatment, which is to compare the controls determined through the process of risk 
treatment (referred to as “necessary” controls), with those in ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are 
issued from in this document) to ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.
Once the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine the attribute values. For 
example, the organization might identify 9 events:
1)	 loss or theft of mobile device;
2)	 loss or theft from organization’s premises;
3)	 force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;
4)	 failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;
5)	 fraud;
6)	 hacking;
7)	 disclosure;
8)	 breach of the law;
9)	 social engineering.
The second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers to each event (e.g. E1, E2, ..., E9).
The third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names from this document into a spreadsheet 
or database and associate the attribute values with each control, remembering that each control can 
have more than one attribute value.
The final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to extract the required information.
Other examples of organizational attributes (and possible values) include:
a)	 maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity models);
b)	 implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented, fully implemented);
c)	
priority (1, 2, 3, etc.);
d)	 organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top management, etc.);
e)	 events;
f)	
assets involved;
e)	 build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different steps of the service life cycle;
g)	 other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning from.
