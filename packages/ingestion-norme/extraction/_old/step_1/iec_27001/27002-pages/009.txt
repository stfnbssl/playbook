ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
0.7   Related International Standards
While this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are 
commonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC  27000 family 
provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing 
information security.
Refer to ISO/IEC  27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents. 
ISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000 
family of documents, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.
There are sector-specific standards that have additional controls which aim at addressing specific 
areas (e.g. ISO/IEC  27017 for cloud services, ISO/IEC  27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC  27019 for energy, 
ISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are 
included in the Bibliography and some of them are referenced in the guidance and other information 
sections in Clauses 5-8.
