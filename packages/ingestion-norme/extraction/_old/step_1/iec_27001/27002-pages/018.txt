ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
—	 Annex B — Correspondence with ISO/IEC 27002:2013
Annex A explains how an organization can use attributes (see 4.2) to create its own views based on the 
control attributes defined in this document or of its own creation.
Annex  B shows the correspondence between the controls in this edition of ISO/IEC  27002 and the 
previous 2013 edition.
4.2	 Themes and attributes
The categorization of controls given in Clauses 5 to 8 are referred to as themes.
Controls are categorized as:
a)	 people, if they concern individual people;
b)	 physical, if they concern physical objects;
c)	
technological, if they concern technology;
d)	 otherwise they are categorized as organizational.
The organization can use attributes to create different views which are different categorizations of 
controls as seen from a different perspective to the themes. Attributes can be used to filter, sort or 
present controls in different views for different audiences. Annex A explains how this can be achieved 
and provides an example of a view.
By way of example, each control in this document has been associated with five attributes with 
corresponding attribute values (preceded by "#" to make them searchable), as follows:
a)	 Control type
Control type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of when and how the control 
modifies the risk with regard to the occurrence of an information security incident. Attribute values 
consist of Preventive (the control that is intended to prevent the occurrence of an information 
security incident), Detective (the control acts when an information security incident occurs) and 
Corrective (the control acts after an information security incident occurs).
b)	 Information security properties
Information security properties is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of which 
characteristic of information the control will contribute to preserving. Attribute values consist of 
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
c)	
Cybersecurity concepts
Cybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of the association 
of controls to cybersecurity concepts defined in the cybersecurity framework described in 
ISO/IEC TS 27110. Attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.
d)	 Operational capabilities
Operational capabilities is an attribute to view controls from the practitioner’s perspective of 
information security capabilities. Attribute values consist of Governance, Asset_management, 
Information_protection, 
Human_resource_security, 
Physical_security, 
System_and_network_
security, 
Application_security, 
Secure_configuration, 
Identity_and_access_management, 
Threat_and_vulnerability_management, Continuity, Supplier_relationships_security, Legal_and_
compliance, Information_security_event_management and Information_security_assurance.
