ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
The organization should identify and implement processes and procedures to address security risks 
associated with the use of products and services provided by suppliers. This should also apply to the 
organization’s use of resources of cloud service providers. These processes and procedures should 
include those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the 
supplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier’s products or services or for the 
termination of use of a supplier’s products and services, such as:
a)	 identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial 
services, ICT infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of the organization's information;
b)	 establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the sensitivity of information, 
products and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, on-
site assessments, certifications);
c)	
evaluating and selecting supplier’s products or services that have adequate information security 
controls and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented 
by the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier’s information and information processing and 
hence the organization’s information security;
d)	 defining the organization’s information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers 
can access, monitor, control or use;
e)	 defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can 
affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information;
f)	
assessing and managing the information security risks associated with:
1)	 the suppliers’ use of the organization’s information and other associated assets, including risks 
originating from potential malicious supplier personnel;
2)	 malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including software components and sub-
components used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers;
g)	 monitoring compliance with established information security requirements for each type of 
supplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation;
h)	 mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected through monitoring or by other 
means;
i)	
handling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier products and services including 
responsibilities of both the organization and suppliers;
j)	
resilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the 
supplier’s information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization’s 
information;
k)	 awareness and training for the organization’s personnel interacting with supplier personnel 
regarding appropriate rules of engagement, topic-specific policies, processes and procedures 
and behaviour based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization’s 
systems and information;
l)	
managing the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that 
needs to be changed and ensuring that information security is maintained throughout the transfer 
period;
m)	 requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including:
1)	 de-provisioning of access rights;
2)	 information handling;
