Guidance
Supplier agreements should be established and documented to ensure that there is clear understanding 
between the organization and the supplier regarding both parties’ obligations to fulfil relevant 
information security requirements.
The following terms can be considered for inclusion in the agreements in order to satisfy the identified 
information security requirements:
a)	 description of the information to be provided or accessed and methods of providing or accessing 
the information;
b)	 classification of information according to the organization’s classification scheme (see 5.10, 5.12, 
5.13);
c)	
mapping between the organization’s own classification scheme and the classification scheme of the 
supplier;
d)	 legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements, including data protection, handling 
of personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property rights and copyright and a 
description of how it will be ensured that they are met;
e)	 obligation of each contractual party to implement an agreed set of controls, including access 
control, performance review, monitoring, reporting and auditing, and the supplier’s obligations to 
comply with the organization’s information security requirements;
f)	
rules of acceptable use of information and other associated assets, including unacceptable use if 
necessary;
g)	 procedures or conditions for authorization and removal of the authorization for the use of the 
organization’s information and other associated assets by supplier personnel (e.g. through an 
explicit list of supplier personnel authorized to use the organization’s information and other 
associated assets);
h)	 information security requirements regarding the supplier’s ICT infrastructure; in particular, 
minimum information security requirements for each type of information and type of access to 
serve as the basis for individual supplier agreements based on the organization’s business needs 
and risk criteria;
i)	
indemnities and remediation for failure of contractor to meet requirements;
j)	
incident management requirements and procedures (especially notification and collaboration 
during incident remediation);
k)	 training and awareness requirements for specific procedures and information security 
requirements (e.g. for incident response, authorization procedures);
l)	
relevant provisions for sub-contracting, including the controls that need to be implemented, such 
as agreement on the use of sub-suppliers (e.g. requiring to have them under the same obligations of 
the supplier, requiring to have a list of sub-suppliers and notification before any change);
m)	 relevant contacts, including a contact person for information security issues;
n)	 any screening requirements, where legally permissible, for the supplier’s personnel, including 
responsibilities for conducting the screening and notification procedures if screening has not been 
completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern;
o)	 the evidence and assurance mechanisms of third-party attestations for relevant information 
security requirements related to the supplier processes and an independent report on effectiveness 
of controls;
p)	 right to audit the supplier processes and controls related to the agreement;
