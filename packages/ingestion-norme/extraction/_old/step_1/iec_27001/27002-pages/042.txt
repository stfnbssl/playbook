Control
Access rights to information and other associated assets should be provisioned, reviewed, modified 
and removed in accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on and rules for access control.
Purpose
To ensure access to information and other associated assets is defined and authorized according to the 
business requirements.
Guidance
Provision and revocation of access rights
The provisioning process for assigning or revoking physical and logical access rights granted to an 
entity’s authenticated identity should include:
a)	 obtaining authorization from the owner of the information and other associated assets for the use 
of the information and other associated assets (see 5.9). Separate approval for access rights by 
management can also be appropriate;
b)	 considering the business requirements and the organization’s topic-specific policy and rules on 
access control;
c)	
considering segregation of duties, including segregating the roles of approval and implementation 
of the access rights and separation of conflicting roles;
d)	 ensuring access rights are removed when someone does not need to access the information and 
other associated assets, in particular ensuring access rights of users who have left the organization 
are removed in a timely fashion;
e)	 considering giving temporary access rights for a limited time period and revoking them at the 
expiration date, in particular for temporary personnel or temporary access required by personnel;
f)	
verifying that the level of access granted is in accordance with the topic-specific policies on 
access control (see 5.15) and is consistent with other information security requirements such as 
segregation of duties (see 5.3);
g)	 ensuring that access rights are activated (e.g. by service providers) only after authorization 
procedures are successfully completed;
h)	 maintaining a central record of access rights granted to a user identifier (ID, logical or physical) to 
access information and other associated assets;
i)	
modifying access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs;
j)	
removing or adjusting physical and logical access rights, which can be done by removal, revocation 
or replacement of keys, authentication information, identification cards or subscriptions;
k)	 maintaining a record of changes to users’ logical and physical access rights.
