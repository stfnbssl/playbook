ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Prior to deploying this control, the organization should establish rules for safe and appropriate use 
of online resources, including any restriction to undesirable or inappropriate websites and web-based 
applications. The rules should be kept up-to-date.
Training should be given to personnel on the secure and appropriate use of online resources including 
access to the web. The training should include the organization’s rules, contact point for raising security 
concerns, and exception process when restricted web resources need to be accessed for legitimate 
business reasons. Training should also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any 
browser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows the user to proceed.
Other information
Web filtering can include a range of techniques including signatures, heuristics, list of acceptable 
websites or domains, list of prohibited websites or domains and bespoke configuration to help prevent 
malicious software and other malicious activity from attacking the organization’s network and systems.

Control
Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, should be defined 
and implemented.
Purpose
To ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity or 
integrity of information according to business and information security requirements, and taking into 
consideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to cryptography.
Guidance
General
When using cryptography, the following should be considered:
a)	 the topic-specific policy on cryptography defined by the organization, including the general 
principles for the protection of information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is 
necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and 
to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;
b)	 identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and 
consequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;
c)	
the use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or 
storage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;
d)	 the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of 
cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or 
damaged keys;
e)	 roles and responsibilities for:
1)	 the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;
