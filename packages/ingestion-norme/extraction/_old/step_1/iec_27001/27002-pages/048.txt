ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Guidance
The following topics should be considered to address information security within ICT supply chain 
security in addition to the general information security requirements for supplier relationships:
a)	 defining information security requirements to apply to ICT product or service acquisition;
b)	 requiring that ICT services suppliers propagate the organization’s security requirements 
throughout the supply chain if they sub-contract for parts of the ICT service provided to the 
organization;
c)	
requiring that ICT products suppliers propagate appropriate security practices throughout the 
supply chain if these products include components purchased or acquired from other suppliers or 
other entities (e.g. sub-contracted software developers and hardware component providers);
d)	 requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information describing the software components 
used in products;
e)	 requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information describing the implemented security 
functions of their product and the configuration required for its secure operation;
f)	
implementing a monitoring process and acceptable methods for validating that delivered ICT 
products and services comply with stated security requirements. Examples of such supplier review 
methods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the 
supplier’s information security operations;
g)	 implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or service components that 
are critical for maintaining functionality and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny 
and further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier 
outsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers;
h)	 obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be traced throughout the supply 
chain;
i)	
obtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning as expected without any 
unexpected or unwanted features;
j)	
implementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from 
their specification. Example measures include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications 
or digital signatures. Monitoring for out of specification performance can be an indicator of 
tampering or counterfeits. Prevention and detection of tampering should be implemented during 
multiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration, 
operations and maintenance;
k)	 obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security levels, for example, through formal 
certification or an evaluation scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement;
l)	
defining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain and any potential issues and 
compromises among the organization and suppliers;
m)	 implementing specific processes for managing ICT component life cycle and availability and 
associated security risks. This includes managing the risks of components no longer being available 
due to suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer providing these components due 
to technology advancements. Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to transfer 
software and competence to the alternative supplier should be considered.
Other information
The specific ICT supply chain risk management practices are built on top of general information 
security, quality, project management and system engineering practices but do not replace them.
