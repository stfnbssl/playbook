ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
a)	 evaluation of information security events according to criteria for what constitutes an information 
security incident;
b)	 monitoring (see 8.15 and 8.16), detecting (see 8.16), classifying (see 5.25), analysing and reporting 
(see 6.8) of information security events and incidents (by human or automatic means);
c)	
managing information security incidents to conclusion, including response and escalation (see 5.26), 
according to the type and the category of the incident, possible activation of crisis management and 
activation of continuity plans, controlled recovery from an incident and communication to internal 
and external interested parties;
d)	 coordination with internal and external interested parties such as authorities, external interest 
groups and forums, suppliers and clients (see 5.5 and 5.6);
e)	 logging incident management activities;
f)	
handling of evidence (see 5.28);
g)	 root cause analysis or post-mortem procedures;
h)	 identification of lessons learned and any improvements to the incident management procedures or 
information security controls in general that are required.
Reporting procedures
Reporting procedures should include:
a)	 actions to be taken in case of an information security event (e.g. noting all pertinent details 
immediately such as malfunction occurring and messages on screen, immediately reporting to the 
point of contact and only taking coordinated actions);
b)	 use of incident forms to support personnel to perform all necessary actions when reporting 
information security incidents;
c)	
suitable feedback processes to ensure that those persons reporting information security events are 
notified, to the extent possible, of outcomes after the issue has been addressed and closed;
d)	 creation of incident reports.
Any external requirements on reporting of incidents to relevant interested parties within the 
defined time frame (e.g. breach notification requirements to regulators) should be considered when 
implementing incident management procedures.
Other information
Information security incidents can transcend organizational and national boundaries. To respond to 
such incidents, it is beneficial to coordinate response and share information about these incidents with 
external organizations as appropriate.
Detailed guidance on information security incident management is provided in the ISO/IEC  27035 
series.
