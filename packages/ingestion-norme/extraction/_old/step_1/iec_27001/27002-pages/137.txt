Development, testing and production environments should be separated and secured.
Purpose
To protect the production environment and data from compromise by development and test activities.
Guidance
The level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary 
to prevent production problems should be identified and implemented.
The following items should be considered:
a)	 adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different 
domains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments);
b)	 defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software 
from development to production status;
c)	
testing changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to 
being applied to production systems (see 8.29);
d)	 not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and 
approved;
e)	 compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from 
production systems when not required;
f)	
displaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error;
g)	 not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless 
equivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems.
In all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering:
a)	 patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders, 
integrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries);
b)	 secure configuration of systems and software;
c)	
control of access to the environments;
d)	 monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;
e)	 secure monitoring of the environments;
f)	
taking backups of the environments.
A single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without 
prior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights 
or through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed 
logging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized 
changes.
