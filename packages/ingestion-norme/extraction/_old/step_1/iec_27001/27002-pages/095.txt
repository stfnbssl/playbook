ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
Control
Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the 
established topic-specific policy on access control.
Purpose
To ensure only authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other 
associated assets.
Guidance
Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the 
established topic-specific policies. The following should be considered in order to support access 
restriction requirements:
a)	 not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public 
or anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive 
information;
b)	 providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and 
services;
c)	
controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user;
d)	 controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and 
execute;
e)	 providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application 
data, or systems.
Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that 
has high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:
a)	 needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;
b)	 wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over 
who can access it;
c)	
wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;
d)	 wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution 
(including printing);
e)	 wants to monitor the use of the information;
f)	
wants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is 
required.
Dynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e. 
creation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:
a)	 establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:
1)	 granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;
2)	 leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be 
protected with dynamic access management techniques;
b)	 establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical 
infrastructure.
