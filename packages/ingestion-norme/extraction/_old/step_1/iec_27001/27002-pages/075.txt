Control
Security measures should be implemented when personnel are working remotely to protect information 
accessed, processed or stored outside the organization’s premises.
Purpose
To ensure the security of information when personnel are working remotely.
Guidance
Remote working occurs whenever personnel of the organization work from a location outside of 
the organization’s premises, accessing information whether in hardcopy or electronically via ICT 
equipment. Remote working environments include those referred to as “teleworking”, “telecommuting”, 
“flexible workplace”, “virtual work environments" and “remote maintenance”.
NOTE	
It is possible that not all the recommendations in this guidance can be applied due to local legislation 
and regulations in different jurisdictions.
Organizations allowing remote working activities should issue a topic-specific policy on remote 
working that defines the relevant conditions and restrictions. Where deemed applicable, the following 
matters should be considered:
a)	 the existing or proposed physical security of the remote working site, taking into account the 
physical security of the location and the local environment, including the different jurisdictions 
where personnel are located;
b)	 rules and security mechanisms for the remote physical environment such as lockable filing 
cabinets, secure transportation between locations and rules for remote access, clear desk, printing 
and disposal of information and other associated assets, and information security event reporting 
(see 6.8);
c)	
the expected physical remote working environments;
d)	 the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access to 
the organization’s systems, the sensitivity of the information to be accessed and passed over the 
communication link and the sensitivity of the systems and applications;
e)	 the use of remote access such as virtual desktop access that supports processing and storage of 
information on privately owned equipment;
f)	
the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons at the remote 
working site (e.g. family and friends);
g)	 the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons in public places;
h)	 the use of home networks and public networks, and requirements or restrictions on the 
configuration of wireless network services;
i)	
use of security measures, such as firewalls and protection against malware;
