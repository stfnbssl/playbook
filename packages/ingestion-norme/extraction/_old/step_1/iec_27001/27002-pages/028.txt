ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)
a)	 what information is involved (information determination), what are the corresponding information 
security needs (classification; see 5.12) and the potential negative business impact which can result 
from lack of adequate security;
b)	 the required protection needs of information and other associated assets involved, particularly in 
terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability;
c)	
the level of confidence or assurance required towards the claimed identity of entities in order to 
derive the authentication requirements;
d)	 access provisioning and authorization processes, for customers and other potential business users 
as well as for privileged or technical users such as relevant project members, potential operation 
staff or external suppliers;
e)	 informing users of their duties and responsibilities;
f)	
requirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging and monitoring, non-
repudiation requirements;
g)	 requirements mandated by other information security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and 
monitoring or data leakage detection systems);
h)	 compliance with the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual environment in which the 
organization operates;
i)	
level of confidence or assurance required for third parties to meet the organization’s information 
security policy and topic-specific policies including relevant security clauses in any agreements or 
contracts.
Other information
The project development approach, such as waterfall life cycle or agile life cycle, should support 
information security in a structured way that can be adapted to suit the assessed severity of the 
information security risks, based on the character of the project. Early consideration of information 
security requirements for the product or service (e.g. at the planning and design stages), can lead 
to more effective and cost-efficient solutions for quality and information security. ISO  21500 and 
ISO 21502 provide guidance on concepts and processes of project management that are important for 
the performance of projects.
ISO/IEC 27005 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify controls to meet 
information security requirements.
