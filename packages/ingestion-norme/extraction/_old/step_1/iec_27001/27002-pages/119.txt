Other information
The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of event logs, which can 
be required for investigations or as evidence in legal and disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs can 
hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence.

Control
The use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and application controls should be 
restricted and tightly controlled.
Purpose
To ensure the use of utility programs does not harm system and application controls for information 
security.
Guidance
The following guidelines for the use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and 
application controls should be considered:
a)	 limitation of the use of utility programs to the minimum practical number of trusted, authorized 
users (see 8.2);
b)	 use of identification, authentication and authorization procedures for utility programs, including 
unique identification of the person who uses the utility program;
c)	
defining and documenting of authorization levels for utility programs;
d)	 authorization for ad hoc use of utility programs;
e)	 not making utility programs available to users who have access to applications on systems where 
segregation of duties is required;
f)	
removing or disabling all unnecessary utility programs;
g)	 at a minimum, logical segregation of utility programs from application software. Where practical, 
segregating network communications for such programs from application traffic;
h)	 limitation of the availability of utility programs (e.g. for the duration of an authorized change);
i)	
logging of all use of utility programs.
Other information
Most information systems have one or more utility programs that can be capable of overriding system 
and application controls, for example diagnostics, patching, antivirus, disk defragmenters, debuggers, 
backup and network tools.
