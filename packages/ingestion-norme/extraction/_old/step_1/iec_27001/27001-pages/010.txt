2)	 criteria for performing information security risk assessments;
b)	 ensures that repeated information security risk assessments produce consistent, valid and 
comparable results;

identifies the information security risks:
1)	 apply the information security risk assessment process to identify risks associated with 
the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the 
information security management system; and
2)	 identify the risk owners;
d)	 analyses the information security risks:
1)	 assess the potential consequences that would result if the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1) were to 
materialize;
2)	 assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1); and
3)	 determine the levels of risk;
e)	 evaluates the information security risks:
1)	 compare the results of risk analysis with the risk criteria established in 6.1.2 a); and
2)	 prioritize the analysed risks for risk treatment.
The organization shall retain documented information about the information security risk assessment 
process.
6.1.3	
​Information security risk treatment
The organization shall define and apply an information security risk treatment process to:
a)	 select appropriate information security risk treatment options, taking account of the risk 
assessment results;
b)	 determine all controls that are necessary to implement the information security risk treatment 
option(s) chosen;
NOTE 1	
Organizations can design controls as required, or identify them from any source.
c)	
compare the controls determined in 6.1.3 b) above with those in Annex  A and verify that no 
necessary controls have been omitted;
NOTE 2	
Annex  A contains a list of possible information security controls. Users of this document are 
directed to Annex A to ensure that no necessary information security controls are overlooked.
NOTE 3	
The information security controls listed in Annex A are not exhaustive and additional information 
security controls can be included if needed.
