system owner 
(or program manager) 
Official responsible for the overall procurement, development, 
integration, modification, operation, and maintenance of a 
system. 
system 
security officer 
[SP 800-37] 
Individual with assigned responsibility for maintaining the 
appropriate operational security posture for a system or 
program. 
system security plan 
See security plan.  
system service 
A capability provided by a system that facilitates information 
processing, storage, or transmission. 
system-related security 
risk 
[SP 800-30] 
Risk that arises through the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or 
availability of information or systems and that considers impacts 
to the organization (including assets, mission, functions, image, 
or reputation), individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 
See risk. 
system-specific control 
[OMB A-130] 
A security or privacy control for an information system that is 
implemented at the system level and is not inherited by any 
other information system. 
systems engineering 
[SP 800-160-1] 
An engineering discipline whose responsibility is creating and 
executing an interdisciplinary process to ensure that the 
customer and all other stakeholder needs are satisfied in a high-
quality, trustworthy, cost-efficient, and schedule-compliant 
manner throughout a systemâ€™s entire life cycle. 
systems security 
engineering 
[SP 800-160-1] 
A specialty engineering field strongly related to systems 
engineering. It applies scientific, engineering, and information 
assurance principles to deliver trustworthy systems that satisfy 
stakeholder requirements within their established risk tolerance. 
tailored control baseline 
A set of controls that result from the application of tailoring 
guidance to a control baseline. See tailoring. 
tailoring 
The process by which security control baselines are modified by: 
identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping 
considerations on the applicability and implementation of 
baseline controls, selecting compensating security controls, 
assigning specific values to organization-defined security control 
parameters, supplementing baselines with additional security 
controls or control enhancements, and providing additional 
specification information for control implementation. 
tampering 
[CNSSI 4009] 
An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification 
of a system, components of systems, its intended behavior, or
