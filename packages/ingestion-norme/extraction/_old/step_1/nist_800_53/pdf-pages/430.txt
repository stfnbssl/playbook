external system service 
A system service that is provided by an external service provider 
and for which the organization has no direct control over the 
implementation of required security and privacy controls or the 
assessment of control effectiveness. 
external system service 
provider  
A provider of external system services to an organization 
through a variety of consumer-producer relationships, including 
joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements 
(i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of 
business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply 
chain exchanges. 
external network 
A network not controlled by the organization. 
failover 
The capability to switch over automatically (typically without 
human intervention or warning) to a redundant or standby 
system upon the failure or abnormal termination of the 
previously active system. 
federal information 
system 
[OMB A-130] 
An information system used or operated by an executive agency, 
by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another 
organization on behalf of an executive agency. 
FIPS-validated 
cryptography 
A cryptographic module validated by the Cryptographic Module 
Validation Program (CMVP) to meet requirements specified in 
FIPS Publication 140-3 (as amended). As a prerequisite to CMVP 
validation, the cryptographic module is required to employ a 
cryptographic algorithm implementation that has successfully 
passed validation testing by the Cryptographic Algorithm 
Validation Program (CAVP). See NSA-approved cryptography. 
firmware 
[CNSSI 4009] 
Computer programs and data stored in hardware - typically in 
read-only memory (ROM) or programmable read-only memory 
(PROM) - such that the programs and data cannot be 
dynamically written or modified during execution of the 
programs. See hardware and software.  
hardware 
[CNSSI 4009] 
The material physical components of a system. See software and 
firmware. 
high-impact system 
[FIPS 200] 
A system in which at least one security objective (i.e., 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS 
Publication 199 potential impact value of high. 
hybrid control 
[OMB A-130] 
A security or privacy control that is implemented for an 
information system in part as a common control and in part as a 
system-specific control. 
identifier 
[FIPS 201-2] 
Unique data used to represent a personâ€™s identity and associated 
attributes. A name or a card number are examples of identifiers.  
A unique label used by a system to indicate a specific entity, 
object, or group.
