information type 
[FIPS 199] 
A specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical, 
proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor-sensitive, security 
management) defined by an organization or in some instances, 
by a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation. 
insider 
[CNSSI 4009, Adapted] 
Any person with authorized access to any organizational 
resource, to include personnel, facilities, information, 
equipment, networks, or systems. 
insider threat 
[CNSSI 4009, Adapted] 
The threat that an insider will use her/his authorized access, 
wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the security of 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation. This threat can include damage 
through espionage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of 
national security information, or through the loss or degradation 
of organizational resources or capabilities. 
insider threat program 
[CNSSI 4009, Adapted] 
A coordinated collection of capabilities authorized by the 
organization and used to deter, detect, and mitigate the 
unauthorized disclosure of information. 
interface 
[CNSSI 4009] 
Common boundary between independent systems or modules 
where interactions take place. 
integrity 
[FISMA]  
Guarding against improper information modification or 
destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation 
and authenticity. 
internal network 
A network where the establishment, maintenance, and 
provisioning of security controls are under the direct control of 
organizational employees or contractors. Cryptographic 
encapsulation or similar security technology implemented 
between organization-controlled endpoints provides the same 
effect (at least regarding confidentiality and integrity). An 
internal network is typically organization-owned yet may be 
organization-controlled while not being organization-owned. 
label 
See security label. 
least privilege 
[CNSSI 4009] 
The principle that a security architecture is designed so that each 
entity is granted the minimum system resources and 
authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function. 
local access 
Access to an organizational system by a user (or process acting 
on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection 
without the use of a network.
