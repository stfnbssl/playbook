threat 
[SP 800-30] 
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely 
impact organizational operations, organizational assets, 
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through a system 
via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of 
information, and/or denial of service. 
threat assessment 
[CNSSI 4009] 
Formal description and evaluation of threat to an information 
system. 
threat modeling 
[SP 800-154] 
 
threat source 
[FIPS 200] 
A form of risk assessment that models aspects of the attack and 
defense sides of a logical entity, such as a piece of data, an 
application, a host, a system, or an environment. 
The intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation 
of a vulnerability or a situation and method that may 
accidentally trigger a vulnerability. See threat agent. 
transmission 
[CNSSI 4009] 
The state that exists when information is being electronically 
sent from one location to one or more other locations.  
trusted path 
A mechanism by which a user (through an input device) can 
communicate directly with the security functions of the system 
with the necessary confidence to support the system security 
policy. This mechanism can only be activated by the user or the 
security functions of the system and cannot be imitated by 
untrusted software. 
trustworthiness 
[CNSSI 4009] 
The attribute of a person or enterprise that provides confidence 
to others of the qualifications, capabilities, and reliability of that 
entity to perform specific tasks and fulfill assigned 
responsibilities. 
trustworthiness 
(system) 
The degree to which an information system (including the 
information technology components that are used to build the 
system) can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of the information being processed, 
stored, or transmitted by the system across the full range of 
threats. A trustworthy information system is believed to operate 
within defined levels of risk despite the environmental 
disruptions, human errors, structural failures, and purposeful 
attacks that are expected to occur in its environment of 
operation. 
user 
 
Individual, or (system) process acting on behalf of an individual, 
authorized to access a system. 
See organizational user and non-organizational user. 
virtual private network 
[CNSSI 4009] 
Protected information system link utilizing tunneling, security 
controls, and endpoint address translation giving the impression 
of a dedicated line.
