security 
[CNSSI 4009] 
 
A condition that results from the establishment and 
maintenance of protective measures that enable an organization 
to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by 
threats to its use of systems. Protective measures may involve a 
combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, 
recovery, and correction that should form part of the 
organization’s risk management approach. 
security attribute 
An abstraction that represents the basic properties or 
characteristics of an entity with respect to safeguarding 
information. Typically associated with internal data structures— 
including records, buffers, and files within the system—and used 
to enable the implementation of access control and flow control 
policies; reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution 
instructions; or support other aspects of the information security 
policy. 
security categorization 
The process of determining the security category for information 
or a system. Security categorization methodologies are described 
in CNSS Instruction 1253 for national security systems and in 
FIPS Publication 199 for other than national security systems. 
See security category. 
security category 
[OMB A-130] 
The characterization of information or an information system 
based on an assessment of the potential impact that a loss of 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information or 
information system would have on agency operations, agency 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 
security control 
[OMB A-130] 
The safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an 
information system or an organization to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its 
information. 
security control baseline 
[OMB A-130] 
The set of minimum security controls defined for a low-impact, 
moderate-impact, or high-impact information system. 
security domain 
[CNSSI 4009] 
A domain that implements a security policy and is administered 
by a single authority. 
security functionality 
The security-related features, functions, mechanisms, services, 
procedures, and architectures implemented within 
organizational information systems or the environments in 
which those systems operate. 
security functions 
The hardware, software, or firmware of the system responsible 
for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the 
isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. 
security impact analysis 
[SP 800-128] 
 
The analysis conducted by qualified staff within an organization 
to determine the extent to which changes to the system affect 
the security posture of the system.
