configuration settings 
[SP 800-128] 
The set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, 
software, or firmware that affect the security posture and/or 
functionality of the system. 
continuous monitoring 
[SP 800-137] 
Maintaining ongoing awareness to support organizational risk 
decisions. 
control 
See security control or privacy control. 
control assessment 
[SP 800-37] 
The testing or evaluation of the controls in an information 
system or an organization to determine the extent to which the 
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and 
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the 
security or privacy requirements for the system or the 
organization. 
control assessor 
See assessor. 
control baseline 
[SP 800-53B] 
Predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address the 
protection needs of groups, organizations, or communities of 
interest. See privacy control baseline or security control baseline. 
control effectiveness 
A measure of whether a security or privacy control contributes 
to the reduction of information security or privacy risk. 
control enhancement 
Augmentation of a security or privacy control to build in 
additional but related functionality to the control, increase the 
strength of the control, or add assurance to the control. 
control inheritance 
A situation in which a system or application receives protection 
from security or privacy controls (or portions of controls) that 
are developed, implemented, assessed, authorized, and 
monitored by entities other than those responsible for the 
system or application; entities either internal or external to the 
organization where the system or application resides. See 
common control. 
control parameter 
See organization-defined control parameter. 
controlled area 
Any area or space for which an organization has confidence that 
the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient 
to meet the requirements established for protecting the 
information and/or information system. 
controlled interface 
 
An interface to a system with a set of mechanisms that enforces 
the security policies and controls the flow of information 
between connected systems.
