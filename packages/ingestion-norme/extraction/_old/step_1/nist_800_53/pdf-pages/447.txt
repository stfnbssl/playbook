supply chain element 
Organizations, entities, or tools employed for the research and 
development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, 
integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of 
systems and system components. 
supply chain risk 
The potential for harm or compromise that arises as a result of 
security risks from suppliers, their supply chains, and their 
products or services. Supply chain risks include exposures, 
threats, and vulnerabilities associated with the products and 
services traversing the supply chain as well as the exposures, 
threats, and vulnerabilities to the supply chain. 
supply chain risk 
assessment 
A systematic examination of supply chain risks, likelihoods of 
their occurrence, and potential impacts. 
supply chain risk 
management 
 
 
A systematic process for managing cyber supply chain risk 
exposures, threats, and vulnerabilities throughout the supply 
chain and developing risk response strategies to the risks 
presented by the supplier, the supplied products and services, or 
the supply chain. 
system 
[CNSSI 4009] 
 
 
[ISO 15288] 
Any organized assembly of resources and procedures united and 
regulated by interaction or interdependence to accomplish a set 
of specific functions.  
Note: Systems also include specialized systems such as industrial control 
systems, telephone switching and private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and 
environmental control systems. 
Combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or 
more stated purposes. 
Note 1: There are many types of systems. Examples include: general and 
special-purpose information systems; command, control, and communication 
systems; crypto modules; central processing unit and graphics processor 
boards; industrial control systems; flight control systems; weapons, targeting, 
and fire control systems; medical devices and treatment systems; financial, 
banking, and merchandising transaction systems; and social networking 
systems. 
Note 2: The interacting elements in the definition of system include hardware, 
software, data, humans, processes, facilities, materials, and naturally occurring 
physical entities. 
Note 3: System-of-systems is included in the definition of system. 
system component 
[SP 800-128] 
A discrete identifiable information technology asset that 
represents a building block of a system and may include 
hardware, software, and firmware. 
system of records 
[USC 552] 
A group of any records under the control of any agency from 
which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or 
by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual. 
system of records notice 
[OMB A-108] 
The notice(s) published by an agency in the Federal Register 
upon the establishment and/or modification of a system of 
records describing the existence and character of the system.
