 Anhang C (normativ) - Akzeptanzkriterien
 6.1
 Vorbemerkung
 Die Anforderungen werden nachfolgend im ursprünglichen englischen Text angegeben, da geplant ist
 das vorliegende Prüfschema zukünftig zu übersetzen und international einzubringen, siehe Kapitel 3.2
 "Zertifizierung".
 Die Akzeptanzkriterien sind primär als "accept" positiv formuliert. In manchen Fällen ist ein expliziter
 Ausschluss einer Umsetzung zur besseren Hervorhebung allerdings sinnvoll, diese Kriterien sind un-
