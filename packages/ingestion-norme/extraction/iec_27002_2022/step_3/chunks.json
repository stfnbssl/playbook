        "guidance": "At the highest level, the organization should define an “information security policy” which is approved\nby top management and which sets out the organization’s approach to managing its information\nsecurity.\nThe information security policy should take into consideration requirements derived from:\na) business strategy and requirements;\nb) regulations, legislation and contracts;\nc)\nthe current and projected information security risks and threats.\nThe information security policy should contain statements concerning:\na) definition of information security;\nb) information security objectives or the framework for setting information security objectives;\nc)\nprinciples to guide all activities relating to information security;\nd) commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information security;\ne) commitment to continual improvement of the information security management system;\nf)\nassignment of responsibilities for information security management to defined roles;\ng) procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions.\nTop management should approve any changes to the information security policy.\nAt a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies as\nneeded, to further mandate the implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific policies\nare typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to\ncover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the\ninformation security policy of the organization.\nExamples of such topics include:\na) access control;\nb) physical and environmental security;\nc)\nasset management;\nd) information transfer;\ne) secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;\nf)\nnetworking security;\ng) information security incident management;\nh) backup;\ni)\ncryptography and key management;\nj)\ninformation classification and handling;\nk) management of technical vulnerabilities;\nl)\nsecure development.\n\b\n\b\n\nThe responsibility for the development, review and approval of the topic-specific policies should be\nallocated to relevant personnel based on their appropriate level of authority and technical competency.\nThe review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information\nsecurity policy and topic-specific policies and managing information security in response to changes\nto:\na) the organization’s business strategy;\nb) the organization’s technical environment;\nc)\nregulations, statutes, legislation and contracts;\nd) information security risks;\ne) the current and projected information security threat environment;\nf)\nlessons learned from information security events and incidents.\nThe review of information security policy and topic-specific policies should take the results of\nmanagement reviews and audits into account. Review and update of other related policies should be\nconsidered when one policy is changed to maintain consistency.\nThe information security policy and topic-specific policies should be communicated to relevant\npersonnel and interested parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the\nintended reader. Recipients of the policies should be required to acknowledge they understand and\nagree to comply with the policies where applicable. The organization can determine the formats\nand names of these policy documents that meet the organization’s needs. In some organizations, the\ninformation security policy and topic-specific policies can be in a single document. The organization\ncan name these topic-specific policies as standards, directives, policies or others.\nIf the information security policy or any topic-specific policy is distributed outside the organization,\ncare should be taken not to improperly disclose confidential information.\nTable 1 illustrates the differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy.\nTable 1 — Differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy\nInformation security policy\nTopic-specific policy\nLevel of detail\nGeneral or high-level\nSpecific and detailed\nDocumented and formally\napproved by\nTop management\nAppropriate level of management",

Individuals with allocated information security\nresponsibilities can assign security tasks to others. However, they remain accountable and should\ndetermine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.\nEach security area for which individuals are responsible should be defined, documented and\ncommunicated.

One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible\nfor its day-to-day protection.\nDepending on the size and resourcing of an organization, information security can be covered by\ndedicated roles or duties carried out in addition to existing roles.",

Small\norganizations can find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied\nas far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls should be\nconsidered, such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision.\nCare should be taken when using role-based access control systems to ensure that persons are not\ngranted conflicting roles. When there is a large number of roles, the organization should consider using\nautomated tools to identify conflicts and facilitate their removal. Roles should be carefully defined and\nprovisioned to minimize access problems if a role is removed or reassigned.",

Considering\nthat the inventory should be maintained by the relevant functions, it can be seen as a set of dynamic\ninventories, such as inventories for information assets, hardware, software, virtual machines (VMs),\nfacilities, personnel, competence, capabilities and records.\nEach asset should be classified in accordance with the classification of the information (see 5.12)\nassociated to that asset.\nThe granularity of the inventory of information and other associated assets should be at a level\nappropriate for the needs of the organization. Sometimes specific instances of assets in the information\nlife cycle are not feasible to be documented due to the nature of the asset. An example of a short-lived\nasset is a VM instance whose life cycle can be of short duration.\nOwnership\nFor the identified information and other associated assets, ownership of the asset should be assigned\nto an individual or a group and the classification should be identified (see 5.12, 5.13). A process to\nensure timely assignment of asset ownership should be implemented. Ownership should be assigned\nwhen assets are created or when assets are transferred to the organization. Asset ownership should be\nreassigned as necessary when current asset owners leave or change job roles.\nOwner duties\nThe asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset life\ncycle, ensuring that:\na) information and other associated assets are inventoried;\nb) information and other associated assets are appropriately classified and protected;\nc)\nthe classification is reviewed periodically;\nd) components supporting technology assets are listed and linked, such as database, storage, software\ncomponents and sub-components;\ne) requirements for the acceptable use of information and other associated assets (see 5.10) are\nestablished;\nf)\naccess restrictions correspond with the classification and that they are effective and are reviewed\nperiodically;\ng) information and other associated assets, when deleted or disposed, are handled in a secure manner\nand removed from the inventory;\n\n\nh) they are involved in the identification and management of risks associated with their asset(s);\ni)\nthey support personnel who have the roles and responsibilities of managing their information.",

Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of the\nvalue, sensitivity and criticality of information through their life cycle.\nThe scheme should be aligned to the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.1) and should be able\nto address specific business needs of the organization.\nThe classification can be determined by the level of impact that the information's compromise would\nhave for the organization.

These aspects should be taken into account,\nas over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional\nexpense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead to insufficient controls to protect the\ninformation from compromise.\nAs an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme can be based on four levels as\nfollows:\na) disclosure causes no harm;\nb) disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational impact;\nc)\ndisclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or business objectives;\nd) disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or puts the survival of the\norganization at risk.",

        "other_information": "There are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently\nused principles are:\na) need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in\norder to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and\nhence different access profiles);\nb) need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a\nclear need is present.\nCare should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:\na) establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless\nexpressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless\nexpressly forbidden”;\nb) changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing\nfacilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;\nc)\nchanges in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those\ninitiated by an administrator;\nd) when to define and regularly review the approval.\nAccess control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4,\n8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17).\nThere are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC\n(discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access\ncontrol).\nAccess control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or\nspecific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging\nfrom covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties\nsuch as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and\nhow granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more\ngranularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used\nto define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.\n\b\n\b\n",

Evidence typically needs to be\ncollected in a manner that is admissible in the appropriate national courts of law or another disciplinary\nforum. It should be possible to show that:\na) records are complete and have not been tampered with in any way;\nb) copies of electronic evidence are probably identical to the originals;\nc)\nany information system from which evidence has been gathered was operating correctly at the\ntime the evidence was recorded.\nWhere available, certification or other relevant means of qualification of personnel and tools should be\nsought, so as to strengthen the value of the preserved evidence.\nDigital evidence can transcend organizational or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, it should be\nensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as digital evidence.",

Further\ninformation on privacy information management systems can be found in ISO/IEC 27701. Specific\ninformation regarding privacy information management for public clouds acting as PII processors can\nbe found in ISO/IEC 27018.\n\b\n\b\n\nISO/IEC 29134 provides guidelines for privacy impact assessment (PIA) and gives an example of the\nstructure and content of a PIA report. Compared with ISO/IEC 27005, this is focused on PII processing\nand relevant to those organizations that process PII.

It should also be built on lessons learnt from\ninformation security incidents.\nThe awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate\nphysical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information\nsessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.\nInformation security awareness should cover general aspects such as:\na) management’s commitment to information security throughout the organization;\nb) familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations,\ntaking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws,\nstatutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;\nc)\npersonal accountability for one’s own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards\nsecuring or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties;\nd) basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline\ncontrols [e.g. password security (5.17)];\ne) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security\nmatters, including further information security awareness materials.\nEducation and training\nThe organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical\nteams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for\nconfiguring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services.\nIf there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them.\nThe education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies,\nbeing mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow\ndifferent activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means\nof delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. Technical\npersonnel should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by\nattending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.\n\n",

In such cases, additional technical\nsafeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline\nworking is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled.\nAs far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration\nmanagement (see 8.9) or automated tools.\nUser responsibility\nAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user\nendpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users\nshould be advised to:\na) log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed;\nb) protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or\nspecial locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying\nimportant, sensitive or critical business information unattended;\nc)\nuse devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected\nareas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy\nscreen filters);\nd) physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport,\nhotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places).\nA specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance)\nand other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of\nuser endpoint devices.\nUse of personal devices\nWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to\nthe guidance given in this control, the following should be considered:\na) separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such\nseparation and protect business data on a private device;\nb) providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical\nprotection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping\nof data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use\nthe service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered;\nc)\ntopic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property\ndeveloped on privately owned equipment;\n\b\n\b\n\nd) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an\ninvestigation), which can be prevented by legislation;\ne) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for\nclient software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.\nWireless connections\nThe organization should establish procedures for:\na) the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols);\nb) using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant\ntopic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).",

In particular,\nback-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network\nbandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are\nscheduled.\nFor some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other\npurposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).",

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in\nthe inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;\nc)\nrequiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability\nreporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);\nd) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities\nand to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;\ne) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments\nby competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising\ncaution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;\nf)\ntracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should be\nincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).\nThe organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:\na) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component\nused in these;\nb) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.\nThe organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability\ndisclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish\nvulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat\nintelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programs\n\b\n\b\n\nwhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order\nto appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent\nindustry bodies or other interested parties.\nEvaluating technical vulnerabilities\nTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:\na) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;\nb) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and\nthe actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other\ncontrols.\nTaking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilities\nA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved\npatches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the\noriginal software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should\nbe fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades.\nIf required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.\nThe following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:\na) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical\nvulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical\nvulnerabilities;\nb) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action\naccording to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information\nsecurity incident response procedures (see 5.26);\nc)\nonly using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);\nd) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not\nresult in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks\nassociated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared\nwith the risk of installing the update)];\ne) addressing systems at high risk first;\nf)\ndevelop remediation (typically software updates or patches);\ng) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;\nh) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;\ni)\nif no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:\n1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;\n2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;\n3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);\n4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of\nsuitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);\n5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;\n6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.\n\n\nFor acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their\nsoftware and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide\nwhether to use the automatic update or not.\nOther considerations\nAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.\nThe technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order\nto ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.\nAn effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management\nactivities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide\ntechnical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.\nWhere the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical\nvulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service\nprovider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should\nbe part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service\nprovider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are\nrespective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example,\nthe cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the\ncloud services.",
        "other_information": "Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as\nsuch can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).\nThere is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side\neffects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been\napplied.\nIf adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in\nupdating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other\nusers. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.\nWhere software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an\nautomated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without\nthe need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can\nallow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of\nthe installation of the update.\nWhere the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected\nsystems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the\nautomated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over\nwhen the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated\nuntil the operation has completed.\nA weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth:\ntwo countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked\nby strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability\nscanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care\nin reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.\nMany organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization\nbut also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems,\nproducts and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.\n\b\n\b\n\nOrganizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically\nthrough a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database\nservices.\nFor more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud\ncomputing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.\nISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing\nvulnerability advisories.

Data anonymization should consider all the elements\nof the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can\nbe identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of\nfurther data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.\nAdditional techniques for data masking include:\na) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);\nb) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);\n\b\n\b\n\nc)\nvarying numbers and dates;\nd) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);\ne) replacing values with their hash.\nThe following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:\na) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show\nonly the minimum required data to the user;\nb) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of\ndata; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient\ndoes not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the\nhospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff\nwith specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);\nc)\nwhen data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if\nthe data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example\nif the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or\nresults of blood exams has been obfuscated);\nd) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information\nduring processing or storage).\nThe following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:\na) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of\nthe processed data;\nb) access controls to the processed data;\nc)\nagreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;\nd) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;\ne) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.",

Knowledge of the algorithm\n(sometimes referred to as the “additional information”) used to perform the pseudonymization allows\nfor at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such “additional information” should\ntherefore be kept separate and protected.\nWhile pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be\nmore useful in statistical research.\nData masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking\ncan be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and\nrules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application’s memory).\nHash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they\nshould always be combined with a salt function.\nPII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should\nbe either avoided or appropriately anonymized.\nAdditional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.\n\n\nAdditional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.",

        "guidance": "General\nThe organization should determine the purpose for which logs are created, what data is collected and\nlogged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data. This should be\ndocumented in a topic-specific policy on logging.\nEvent logs should include for each event, as applicable:\na) user IDs;\nb) system activities;\nc)\ndates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);\nd) device identity, system identifier and location;\ne) network addresses and protocols.\nThe following events should be considered for logging:\na) successful and rejected system access attempts;\nb) successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;\nc)\nchanges to system configuration;\nd) use of privileges;\ne) use of utility programs and applications;\nf)\nfiles accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files;\ng) alarms raised by the access control system;\nh) activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection\nsystems;\ni)\ncreation, modification or deletion of identities;\nj)\ntransactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or\nproduct provided or run by a third party.\nIt is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation\nof logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident.\nProtection of logs\nUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate\nlogs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing\nfacilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain\naccountability for the privileged users.\nControls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational\nproblems with the logging facility including:\na) alterations to the message types that are recorded;\n\b\n\b\n\nb) log files being edited or deleted;\nc)\nfailure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log\nfile is exceeded.\nFor protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing,\nrecording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.\nSome audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or\nrequirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28).\nWhere the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or\ntroubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see\n8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization\nname, before sending to the vendor.\nEvent logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy\nprotection measures should be taken (see 5.34).\nLog analysis\nLog analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify\nunusual activity or anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.\nAnalysis of events should be performed by taking into account:\na) the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;\nb) determining the procedure of log analysis;\nc)\nthe required attributes of each security-related event;\nd) exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and\nevent management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware\nsignatures];\ne) known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and\nbehaviour [user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA)];\nf)\nresults of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and\nspecialized analysis tools);\ng) available threat intelligence.\nLog analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyse\nanomalous behaviour, which includes:\na) reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name\nsystem (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares];\nb) checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those\nassociated with botnet command and control servers;\nc)\nexamining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual\nactivity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);\nd) including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate\ndetection and incident analysis;\ne) correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.\n\n\nSuspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or\nprobing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security\nincident management process, see 5.25).",
        "other_information": "System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information\nsecurity monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes,\nthe use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered.\nEvent logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of\ngenerating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.\nA SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyse log information,\nand to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits.\nConfigurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and\ntesting of rules and development of use cases.\nPublic transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency\nsystems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log\ntampering.\nIn cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service\ncustomer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service\nbeing used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.",

When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:\na) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;\nb) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.\nThe monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous\nbehaviour, such as:\na) unplanned termination of processes or applications;\nb) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses\nor network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);\nc)\nknown attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);\nd) unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of\nstandard protocols);\ne) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);\nf)\nunauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;\ng) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;\nh) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals\nand file systems);\ni)\nunusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.\nContinuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or\nin periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include\nthe ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow\nfor real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or\nnetwork or application behaviour patterns.\nAutomated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles,\nemail messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system\nshould be tuned and trained on the organization’s baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should\nbe dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential\nincidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert\nnotifications.\nAbnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following\nactivities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures\nshould be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in\norder to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security.

This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the\nfast-changing threat landscape.\nPlanning and before coding\nSecure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These\nprinciples should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products\nand services supplied by the organization to others.

Static application security testing\n(SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.\nBefore software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:\na) attack surface and the principle of least privilege;\nb) conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have\nbeen mitigated.\nReview and maintenance\nAfter code has been made operational:\na) updates should be securely packaged and deployed;\nb) reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8);\nc)\nerrors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to\nthe code as necessary;\nd) source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using\nconfiguration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and\nversion control).\nIf using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:\na) ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used\nand their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;\n\n\nb) selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and\ncryptographic components;\nc)\nthe licence, security and history of external components;\nd) ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;\ne) sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.\nWhere a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:\na) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;\nb) whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;\nc)\nthe possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;\nd) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a\nresult of changes;\ne) compatibility with other software in use.",
        "other_information": "A guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamper-\nresistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for\ndata held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is\nexecuted on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its\ndata is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud\nservice where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access\nshould be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong\nauthentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in\nprinciple can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.\nApplication code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or\nmalicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For\nexample, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds\nbefore the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that\nperforms the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness.\nSome web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design\nand coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be\nmanipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.\nMore information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series.",

        "guidance": "The level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary\nto prevent production problems should be identified and implemented.\nThe following items should be considered:\na) adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different\ndomains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments);\nb) defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software\nfrom development to production status;\nc)\ntesting changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to\nbeing applied to production systems (see 8.29);\nd) not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and\napproved;\ne) compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from\nproduction systems when not required;\nf)\ndisplaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error;\ng) not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless\nequivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems.\nIn all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering:\na) patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders,\nintegrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries);\nb) secure configuration of systems and software;\nc)\ncontrol of access to the environments;\nd) monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\ne) secure monitoring of the environments;\nf)\ntaking backups of the environments.\nA single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without\nprior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights\nor through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed\nlogging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized\nchanges.\n\n",
        "other_information": "Without adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production\nsystems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment,\nsystem failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of\nconfidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable\nenvironment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to\nthe production environment.\nMeasures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing\nsegregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place.\nDevelopment and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information.\nDevelopment and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they\nshare the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments\nis therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production\nsoftware and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information).\nIn some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be\ndeliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled\nrollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can\noccur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live\ndeployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any\none time.\nSupporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33)\nare necessary.\nOrganizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when\nconducting end user training.",
