      "Guidance": "At the highest level, the organization should define an “information security policy” which is approved\nby top management and which sets out the organization’s approach to managing its information\nsecurity.\nThe information security policy should take into consideration requirements derived from:\na) business strategy and requirements;\nb) regulations, legislation and contracts;\nc)\nthe current and projected information security risks and threats.\nThe information security policy should contain statements concerning:\na) definition of information security;\nb) information security objectives or the framework for setting information security objectives;\nc)\nprinciples to guide all activities relating to information security;\nd) commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information security;\ne) commitment to continual improvement of the information security management system;\nf)\nassignment of responsibilities for information security management to defined roles;\ng) procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions.\nTop management should approve any changes to the information security policy.\nAt a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies as\nneeded, to further mandate the implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific policies\nare typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to\ncover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the\ninformation security policy of the organization.\nExamples of such topics include:\na) access control;\nb) physical and environmental security;\nc)\nasset management;\nd) information transfer;\ne) secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;\nf)\nnetworking security;\ng) information security incident management;\nh) backup;\ni)\ncryptography and key management;\nj)\ninformation classification and handling;\nk) management of technical vulnerabilities;\nl)\nsecure development.\n\b\n\b\n\nThe responsibility for the development, review and approval of the topic-specific policies should be\nallocated to relevant personnel based on their appropriate level of authority and technical competency.\nThe review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information\nsecurity policy and topic-specific policies and managing information security in response to changes\nto:\na) the organization’s business strategy;\nb) the organization’s technical environment;\nc)\nregulations, statutes, legislation and contracts;\nd) information security risks;\ne) the current and projected information security threat environment;\nf)\nlessons learned from information security events and incidents.\nThe review of information security policy and topic-specific policies should take the results of\nmanagement reviews and audits into account. Review and update of other related policies should be\nconsidered when one policy is changed to maintain consistency.\nThe information security policy and topic-specific policies should be communicated to relevant\npersonnel and interested parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the\nintended reader. Recipients of the policies should be required to acknowledge they understand and\nagree to comply with the policies where applicable. The organization can determine the formats\nand names of these policy documents that meet the organization’s needs. In some organizations, the\ninformation security policy and topic-specific policies can be in a single document. The organization\ncan name these topic-specific policies as standards, directives, policies or others.\nIf the information security policy or any topic-specific policy is distributed outside the organization,\ncare should be taken not to improperly disclose confidential information.\nTable 1 illustrates the differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy.\nTable 1 — Differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy\nInformation security policy\nTopic-specific policy\nLevel of detail\nGeneral or high-level\nSpecific and detailed\nDocumented and formally\napproved by\nTop management\nAppropriate level of management",

Two of the most frequently\nused principles are:\na) need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in\norder to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and\nhence different access profiles);\nb) need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a\nclear need is present.\nCare should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:\na) establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless\nexpressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless\nexpressly forbidden”;\nb) changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing\nfacilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;\nc)\nchanges in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those\ninitiated by an administrator;\nd) when to define and regularly review the approval.\nAccess control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4,\n8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17).\nThere are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC\n(discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access\ncontrol).\nAccess control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or\nspecific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging\nfrom covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties\nsuch as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and\nhow granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more\ngranularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used\nto define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.\n\b\n\b\n",

These processes and procedures should\ninclude those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the\nsupplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier’s products or services or for the\ntermination of use of a supplier’s products and services, such as:\na) identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial\nservices, ICT infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the organization's information;\nb) establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the sensitivity of information,\nproducts and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, on-\nsite assessments, certifications);\nc)\nevaluating and selecting supplier’s products or services that have adequate information security\ncontrols and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented\nby the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier’s information and information processing and\nhence the organization’s information security;\nd) defining the organization’s information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers\ncan access, monitor, control or use;\ne) defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can\naffect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information;\nf)\nassessing and managing the information security risks associated with:\n1) the suppliers’ use of the organization’s information and other associated assets, including risks\noriginating from potential malicious supplier personnel;\n2) malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including software components and sub-\ncomponents used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers;\ng) monitoring compliance with established information security requirements for each type of\nsupplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation;\nh) mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected through monitoring or by other\nmeans;\ni)\nhandling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier products and services including\nresponsibilities of both the organization and suppliers;\nj)\nresilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the\nsupplier’s information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization’s\ninformation;\nk) awareness and training for the organization’s personnel interacting with supplier personnel\nregarding appropriate rules of engagement, topic-specific policies, processes and procedures\nand behaviour based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization’s\nsystems and information;\nl)\nmanaging the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that\nneeds to be changed and ensuring that information security is maintained throughout the transfer\nperiod;\nm) requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including:\n1) de-provisioning of access rights;\n2) information handling;\n\b\n\b\n\n3) determining ownership of intellectual property developed during the engagement;\n4) information portability in case of change of supplier or insourcing;\n6) records management;\n7) return of assets;\n8) secure disposal of information and other associated assets;\n9) ongoing confidentiality requirements;\nn) level of personnel security and physical security expected from supplier's personnel and facilities.\nThe procedures for continuing information processing in the event that the supplier becomes unable to\nsupply its products or services (e.g. because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business,\nor no longer provides some components due to technology advancements) should be considered to\navoid any delay in arranging replacement products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier\nin advance or always using alternative suppliers).",
      "Other information": "In cases where it is not possible for an organization to place requirements on a supplier, the organization\nshould:\na) consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions about choosing a supplier and its\nproduct or service;\nb) implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk assessment.\nInformation can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate information security management. Controls\nshould be determined and applied to manage the supplier's access to information and other associated\nassets. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure\nagreements or cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data protection\nrisks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or access to, information across borders. The\norganization needs to be aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting information\nremains with the organization.\nRisks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure components or services provided\nby suppliers. Malfunctioning or vulnerable components or services can cause information security\nbreaches in the organization or to another entity (e.g. they can cause malware infection, attacks or\nother harm on entities other than the organization).\nSee ISO/IEC 27036-2 for more detail.",

Examples of such supplier review\nmethods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the\nsupplier’s information security operations;\ng) implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or service components that\nare critical for maintaining functionality and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny\nand further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier\noutsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers;\nh) obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be traced throughout the supply\nchain;\ni)\nobtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning as expected without any\nunexpected or unwanted features;\nj)\nimplementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from\ntheir specification.

      "Guidance": "ICT readiness for business continuity is an important component in business continuity management\nand information security management to ensure that the organization’s objectives can continue to be\nmet during disruption.\nThe ICT continuity requirements are the outcome of the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA process\nshould use impact types and criteria to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of\nbusiness activities that deliver products and services. The magnitude and duration of the resulting\nimpact should be used to identify prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time\nobjective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are needed to support prioritized\nactivities. An RTO should also be specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should\ninclude ICT services.\nThe BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance and capacity requirements of\nICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO) of information required to support activities during\ndisruption.\nBased on the outputs from the BIA and risk assessment involving ICT services, the organization should\nidentify and select ICT continuity strategies that consider options for before, during and after disruption.\nThe business continuity strategies can comprise one or more solutions. Based on the strategies, plans\nshould be developed, implemented and tested to meet the required availability level of ICT services and\nin the required time frames following interruption to, or failure of, critical processes.\nThe organization should ensure that:\na) an adequate organizational structure is in place to prepare for, mitigate and respond to a disruption\nsupported by personnel with the necessary responsibility, authority and competence;\nb) ICT continuity plans, including response and recovery procedures detailing how the organization\nis planning to manage an ICT service disruption, are:\n1) regularly evaluated through exercises and tests;\n2) approved by management;\nc)\nICT continuity plans include the following ICT continuity information:\n1) performance and capacity specifications to meet the business continuity requirements and\nobjectives as specified in the BIA;\n2) RTO of each prioritized ICT service and the procedures for restoring those components;\n3) RPO of the prioritized ICT resources defined as information and the procedures for restoring\nthe information.",
      "Other information": "Managing ICT continuity forms a key part of business continuity requirements concerning availability\nto be able to:\na) respond and recover from disruption to ICT services regardless of the cause;\nb) ensure continuity of prioritized activities are supported by the required ICT services;\nc)\nrespond before a disruption to ICT services occurs, and upon detection of at least one incident that\ncan result in a disruption to ICT services.\n\n\nFurther guidance on ICT readiness for business continuity can be found in ISO/IEC 27031.\nFurther guidance on business continuity management systems can be found in ISO 22301 and ISO 22313.\nFurther guidance on BIA can be found in ISO/TS 22317.",

      "Purpose": "To protect information against the risks introduced by using user endpoint devices.",
      "Guidance": "General\nThe organization should establish a topic-specific policy on secure configuration and handling of user\nendpoint devices. The topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel and\nconsider the following:\na) the type of information and the classification level that the user endpoint devices can handle,\nprocess, store or support;\nb) registration of user endpoint devices;\nc)\nrequirements for physical protection;\nd) restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by system administrators);\ne) requirements for user endpoint device software (including software versions) and for applying\nupdates (e.g. active automatic updating);\nf)\nrules for connection to information services, public networks or any other network off premises\n(e.g. requiring the use of personal firewall);\ng) access controls;\nh) storage device encryption;\n\n\ni)\nprotection against malware;\nj)\nremote disabling, deletion or lockout;\nk) backups;\nl)\nusage of web services and web applications;\nm) end user behaviour analytics (see 8.16);\nn) the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices, and the possibility of disabling\nphysical ports (e.g. USB ports);\no) the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user endpoint device, which can securely\nseparate the organization's information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other\ninformation and other associated assets on the device.\nConsideration should be given as to whether certain information is so sensitive that it can only be\naccessed via user endpoint devices, but not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical\nsafeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline\nworking is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled.\nAs far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration\nmanagement (see 8.9) or automated tools.\nUser responsibility\nAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user\nendpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users\nshould be advised to:\na) log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed;\nb) protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or\nspecial locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying\nimportant, sensitive or critical business information unattended;\nc)\nuse devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected\nareas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy\nscreen filters);\nd) physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport,\nhotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places).\nA specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance)\nand other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of\nuser endpoint devices.\nUse of personal devices\nWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to\nthe guidance given in this control, the following should be considered:\na) separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such\nseparation and protect business data on a private device;\nb) providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical\nprotection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping\nof data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use\nthe service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered;\nc)\ntopic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property\ndeveloped on privately owned equipment;\n\b\n\b\n\nd) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an\ninvestigation), which can be prevented by legislation;\ne) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for\nclient software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.\nWireless connections\nThe organization should establish procedures for:\na) the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols);\nb) using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant\ntopic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).",
      "Other information": "Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device\nis used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is\nexposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization.\nThe wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections\nbut have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. In particular,\nback-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network\nbandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are\nscheduled.\nFor some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other\npurposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).",

The following should be\nconsidered:\na) identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system or process (e.g. operating\nsystems, database management systems and applications);\nb) allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an event-by-event basis in line with\nthe topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15) (i.e. only to individuals with the necessary\ncompetence to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum\nrequirement for their functional roles);\n\n\nc)\nmaintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can approve privileged access rights,\nor not granting privileged access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a record of\nall privileges allocated;\nd) defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged access rights;\ne) taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged access rights and when they are\nin privileged access mode. Possible measures include using specific user identities, user interface\nsettings or even specific equipment;\nf)\nauthentication requirements for privileged access rights can be higher than the requirements for\nnormal access rights. Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary before doing\nwork with privileged access rights;\ng) regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users working with privileged access\nrights in order to verify if their duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them for\nworking with privileged access rights (see 5.18);\nh) establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (such as\n“root”), depending on systems’ configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication\ninformation of such identities (see 5.17);\ni)\ngranting temporary privileged access just for the time window necessary to implement approved\nchanges or activities (e.g. for maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than\npermanently granting privileged access rights. This is often referred as break glass procedure, and\noften automated by privilege access management technologies;\nj)\nlogging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes;\nk) not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to multiple persons, assigning each\nperson a separate identity which allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities\ncan be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to simplify the management of\nprivileged access rights;\nl)\nonly using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking administrative tasks and not\nfor day-to-day general tasks [i.e. checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate\nnormal network identity for these activities)].",
      "Other information": "Privileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a role or a process that allows the\nperformance of activities that typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles\ntypically require privileged access rights.\nInappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or facility of an information system\nthat enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to\nfailures or breaches of systems.\nMore information related to access management and the secure management of access to information\nand information and communications technologies resources can be found in ISO/IEC 29146.",

Public\nor anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive\ninformation;\nb) providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and\nservices;\nc)\ncontrolling which data can be accessed by a particular user;\nd) controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and\nexecute;\ne) providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application\ndata, or systems.\nFurther, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that\nhas high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:\na) needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;\nb) wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over\nwho can access it;\nc)\nwants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;\nd) wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution\n(including printing);\ne) wants to monitor the use of the information;\nf)\nwants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is\nrequired.\nDynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e.\ncreation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:\na) establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:\n1) granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;\n2) leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be\nprotected with dynamic access management techniques;\nb) establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical\ninfrastructure.\n\n\nDynamic access management systems should protect information by:\na) requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information;\nb) restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular\ndate);\nc)\nusing encryption to protect information;\nd) defining the printing permissions for the information;\ne) recording who accesses the information and how the information is used;\nf)\nraising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.",
      "Other information": "Dynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can\nsupport the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization,\nwhere traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to documents, emails or other\nfiles containing information to limit who can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular\nlevel and be adapted over the life cycle of the information.\nDynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access management [e.g. using access\ncontrol lists (ACLs)], but can add more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time data\nreduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most sensitive information. It offers a\nway to control access outside the organization’s environment. Incident response can be supported by\ndynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or revoked at any time.\nAdditional information on a framework for access management is provided in ISO/IEC 29146.",

      "Purpose": "To prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.",
      "Guidance": "Identifying technical vulnerabilities\nThe organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see 5.9 to 5.14) as a prerequisite for\neffective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should include the software vendor,\nsoftware name, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what\nsystems) and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software.\nTo identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should consider:\na) defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability\nmanagement, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset\ntracking and any coordination responsibilities required;\nb) for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory list, see 5.9), identifying\ninformation resources that will be used for identifying relevant technical vulnerabilities and\nmaintaining awareness about them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in\nthe inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;\nc)\nrequiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability\nreporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);\nd) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities\nand to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;\ne) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments\nby competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising\ncaution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;\nf)\ntracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should be\nincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).\nThe organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:\na) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component\nused in these;\nb) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.\nThe organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability\ndisclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish\nvulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat\nintelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programs\n\b\n\b\n\nwhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order\nto appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent\nindustry bodies or other interested parties.\nEvaluating technical vulnerabilities\nTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:\na) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;\nb) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and\nthe actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other\ncontrols.\nTaking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilities\nA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved\npatches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the\noriginal software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should\nbe fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades.\nIf required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.\nThe following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:\na) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical\nvulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical\nvulnerabilities;\nb) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action\naccording to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information\nsecurity incident response procedures (see 5.26);\nc)\nonly using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);\nd) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not\nresult in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks\nassociated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared\nwith the risk of installing the update)];\ne) addressing systems at high risk first;\nf)\ndevelop remediation (typically software updates or patches);\ng) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;\nh) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;\ni)\nif no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:\n1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;\n2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;\n3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);\n4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of\nsuitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);\n5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;\n6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.\n\n\nFor acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their\nsoftware and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide\nwhether to use the automatic update or not.\nOther considerations\nAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.\nThe technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order\nto ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.\nAn effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management\nactivities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide\ntechnical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.\nWhere the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical\nvulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service\nprovider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should\nbe part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service\nprovider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are\nrespective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example,\nthe cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the\ncloud services.",
      "Other information": "Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as\nsuch can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).\nThere is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side\neffects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been\napplied.\nIf adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in\nupdating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other\nusers. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.\nWhere software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an\nautomated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without\nthe need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can\nallow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of\nthe installation of the update.\nWhere the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected\nsystems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the\nautomated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over\nwhen the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated\nuntil the operation has completed.\nA weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth:\ntwo countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked\nby strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability\nscanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care\nin reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.\nMany organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization\nbut also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems,\nproducts and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.\n\b\n\b\n\nOrganizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically\nthrough a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database\nservices.\nFor more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud\ncomputing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.\nISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing\nvulnerability advisories.

      "Guidance": "Where the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the organization should consider hiding\nsuch data by using techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.\nPseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise the true identity of PII principals\nor other sensitive information, and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII principal\nor the link between other sensitive information.\nWhen using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be verified that data has been\nadequately pseudonymized or anonymized. Data anonymization should consider all the elements\nof the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can\nbe identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of\nfurther data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.\nAdditional techniques for data masking include:\na) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);\nb) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);\n\b\n\b\n\nc)\nvarying numbers and dates;\nd) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);\ne) replacing values with their hash.\nThe following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:\na) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show\nonly the minimum required data to the user;\nb) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of\ndata; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient\ndoes not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the\nhospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff\nwith specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);\nc)\nwhen data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if\nthe data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example\nif the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or\nresults of blood exams has been obfuscated);\nd) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information\nduring processing or storage).\nThe following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:\na) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of\nthe processed data;\nb) access controls to the processed data;\nc)\nagreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;\nd) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;\ne) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.",
      "Other information": "Anonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified\ndirectly or indirectly.\nPseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm\n(sometimes referred to as the “additional information”) used to perform the pseudonymization allows\nfor at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such “additional information” should\ntherefore be kept separate and protected.\nWhile pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be\nmore useful in statistical research.\nData masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking\ncan be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and\nrules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application’s memory).\nHash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII.

      "Purpose": "To detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or\nsystems.",
      "Guidance": "The organization should consider the following to reduce the risk of data leakage:\na) identifying and classifying information to protect against leakage (e.g. personal information,\npricing models and product designs);\nb) monitoring channels of data leakage (e.g. email, file transfers, mobile devices and portable storage\ndevices);\nc)\nacting to prevent information from leaking (e.g. quarantine emails containing sensitive\ninformation).\nData leakage prevention tools should be used to:\na) identify and monitor sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure (e.g. in unstructured\ndata on a user’s system);\nb) detect the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. when information is uploaded to untrusted\nthird-party cloud services or sent via email);\nc)\nblock user actions or network transmissions that expose sensitive information (e.g. preventing the\ncopying of database entries into a spreadsheet).\nThe organization should determine if it is necessary to restrict a user’s ability to copy and paste or\nupload data to services, devices and storage media outside of the organization. If that is the case, the\norganization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration\nof existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste\noutside of the organization’s control.\nIf data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users\naccountable for their actions.\nTaking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of\nuse, training and auditing.\nWhere data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using\nmeasures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the\nbackup.\nData leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an\nadversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial,\nscientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The\n\b\n\b\n\ndata leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary’s decisions for example by\nreplacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as response\nto the adversary’s intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering\nor the use of honeypots to attract attackers.",
      "Other information": "Data leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and\ntake actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the\ntransfer of data to portable storage devices).\nData leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel’s communications and online\nactivities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be\nconsidered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to\nprivacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to\nmonitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention.\nData leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies\non access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).",

      "Control": "Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults and other relevant events should be produced, stored,\nprotected and analysed.\n\n",
      "Purpose": "To record events, generate evidence, ensure the integrity of log information, prevent against\nunauthorized access, identify information security events that can lead to an information security\nincident and to support investigations.",
      "Guidance": "General\nThe organization should determine the purpose for which logs are created, what data is collected and\nlogged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data. This should be\ndocumented in a topic-specific policy on logging.\nEvent logs should include for each event, as applicable:\na) user IDs;\nb) system activities;\nc)\ndates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);\nd) device identity, system identifier and location;\ne) network addresses and protocols.\nThe following events should be considered for logging:\na) successful and rejected system access attempts;\nb) successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;\nc)\nchanges to system configuration;\nd) use of privileges;\ne) use of utility programs and applications;\nf)\nfiles accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files;\ng) alarms raised by the access control system;\nh) activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection\nsystems;\ni)\ncreation, modification or deletion of identities;\nj)\ntransactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or\nproduct provided or run by a third party.\nIt is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation\nof logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident.\nProtection of logs\nUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate\nlogs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing\nfacilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain\naccountability for the privileged users.\nControls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational\nproblems with the logging facility including:\na) alterations to the message types that are recorded;\n\b\n\b\n\nb) log files being edited or deleted;\nc)\nfailure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log\nfile is exceeded.\nFor protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing,\nrecording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.\nSome audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or\nrequirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28).\nWhere the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or\ntroubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see\n8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization\nname, before sending to the vendor.\nEvent logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy\nprotection measures should be taken (see 5.34).\nLog analysis\nLog analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify\nunusual activity or anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.\nAnalysis of events should be performed by taking into account:\na) the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;\nb) determining the procedure of log analysis;\nc)\nthe required attributes of each security-related event;\nd) exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and\nevent management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware\nsignatures];\ne) known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and\nbehaviour [user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA)];\nf)\nresults of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and\nspecialized analysis tools);\ng) available threat intelligence.\nLog analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyse\nanomalous behaviour, which includes:\na) reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name\nsystem (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares];\nb) checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those\nassociated with botnet command and control servers;\nc)\nexamining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual\nactivity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);\nd) including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate\ndetection and incident analysis;\ne) correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.\n\n\nSuspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or\nprobing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security\nincident management process, see 5.25).",
      "Other information": "System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information\nsecurity monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes,\nthe use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered.\nEvent logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of\ngenerating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.\nA SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyse log information,\nand to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits.\nConfigurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and\ntesting of rules and development of use cases.\nPublic transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency\nsystems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log\ntampering.\nIn cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service\ncustomer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service\nbeing used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.",

When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:\na) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;\nb) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.\nThe monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous\nbehaviour, such as:\na) unplanned termination of processes or applications;\nb) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses\nor network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);\nc)\nknown attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);\nd) unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of\nstandard protocols);\ne) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);\nf)\nunauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;\ng) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;\nh) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals\nand file systems);\ni)\nunusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.\nContinuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or\nin periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include\nthe ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow\nfor real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or\nnetwork or application behaviour patterns.\nAutomated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles,\nemail messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system\nshould be tuned and trained on the organization’s baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should\nbe dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential\nincidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert\nnotifications.\nAbnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following\nactivities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures\nshould be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in\norder to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security.

Software\npatches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities\n(see 8.8 and 8.19).\nComputer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs\nusing modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid\nunauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities.\nVendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported\nby the supplier.

      "Guidance": "Controls should be implemented to ensure the security of information in networks and to protect\nconnected services from unauthorized access. In particular, the following items should be considered:\na) the type and classification level of information that the network can support;\nb) establishing responsibilities and procedures for the management of networking equipment and\ndevices;\nc)\nmaintaining up to date documentation including network diagrams and configuration files of\ndevices (e.g. routers, switches);\nd) separating operational responsibility for networks from ICT system operations where appropriate\n(see 5.3);\ne) establishing controls to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public\nnetworks, third-party networks or over wireless networks and to protect the connected systems\nand applications (see 5.22, 8.24, 5.14 and 6.6). Additional controls can also be required to maintain\nthe availability of the network services and computers connected to the network;\nf)\nappropriately logging and monitoring to enable recording and detection of actions that can affect,\nor are relevant to, information security (see 8.16 and 8.15);\ng) closely coordinating network management activities both to optimize the service to the\norganization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing\ninfrastructure;\n\n\nh) authenticating systems on the network;\ni)\nrestricting and filtering systems connection to the network (e.g. using firewalls);\nj)\ndetecting, restricting and authenticating the connection of equipment and devices to the network;\nk) hardening of network devices;\nl)\nsegregating network administration channels from other network traffic;\nm) temporarily isolating critical subnetworks (e.g. with drawbridges) if the network is under attack;\nn) disabling vulnerable network protocols.\nThe organization should ensure that appropriate security controls are applied to the use of virtualized\nnetworks. Virtualized networks also cover software-defined networking (SDN, SD-WAN). Virtualized\nnetworks can be desirable from a security viewpoint, since they can permit logical separation of\ncommunication taking place over physical networks, particularly for systems and applications that are\nimplemented using distributed computing.",

      "Guidance": "General\nWhen using cryptography, the following should be considered:\na) the topic-specific policy on cryptography defined by the organization, including the general\nprinciples for the protection of information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is\nnecessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and\nto avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;\nb) identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and\nconsequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;\nc)\nthe use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or\nstorage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;\nd) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of\ncryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or\ndamaged keys;\ne) roles and responsibilities for:\n1) the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;\n\n\n2) the key management, including key generation (see 8.24);\nf)\nthe standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic\nsolutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization;\ng) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware\ndetection or content filtering).\nWhen implementing the organization’s rules for effective use of cryptography, the regulations and\nnational restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world\nshould be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information\n(see 5.31).\nThe contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services\n(e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response\ntimes for the provision of services (see 5.22).\nKey management\nAppropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving,\ndistributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.\nA key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and secure\nmethods for:\na) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;\nb) issuing and obtaining public key certificates;\nc)\ndistributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received;\nd) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;\ne) changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done;\nf)\ndealing with compromised keys;\ng) revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised\nor when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)];\nh) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;\ni)\nbacking up or archiving keys;\nj)\ndestroying keys;\nk) logging and auditing of key management related activities;\nl)\nsetting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of\ntime according to the organization's rules on key management;\nm) handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g. encrypted information can be\nrequired to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).\nAll cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private\nkeys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store\nand archive keys should be physically protected.\nIn addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.\n\b\n\b\n",
      "Other information": "The authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key management processes using\ncertificate authorities and public key certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using\ntechnologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.\nCryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example:\na) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either\nstored or transmitted;\nb) integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the\nauthenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using algorithms\nfor the purpose of file integrity checking;\nc)\nnon-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of an event or action;\nd) authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities\nrequesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources.\nThe ISO/IEC 11770 series provides further information on key management.",

      "Guidance": "Security engineering principles should be established, documented and applied to information\nsystem engineering activities. Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data,\napplications and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks and the design\nshould be reviewed against known attack patterns.\nSecure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session\ncontrol and data validation and sanitisation.\nSecure system engineering principles should include analysis of:\na) the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified\nthreats;\nb) the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events;\nc)\nspecific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive\ninformation, integrity checking and digitally signing information);\nd) where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture\nand the technical infrastructure);\ne) how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integrated\nset of controls.\nSecurity engineering principles should take account of:\na) the need to integrate with a security architecture;\n\b\n\b\n\nb) technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access\nmanagement (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management];\nc)\ncapability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology;\nd) cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;\ne) current good practices.\nSecure system engineering should involve:\na) the use of security architecture principles, such as “security by design”, “defence in depth”,\n“security by default”, “default deny”, “fail securely”, “distrust input from external applications”,\n“security in deployment”, “assume breach”, \"least privilege\", “usability and manageability” and\n“least functionality”;\nb) a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure\nsecurity controls are specified and meet security requirements;\nc)\ndocumentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet\nrequirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements);\nd) hardening of systems.\nThe organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:\na) assuming the organization’s information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on\nnetwork perimeter security alone;\nb) employing a “never trust and always verify” approach for access to information systems;\nc)\nensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end;\nd) verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network,\neven if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting\nanything inside or outside its perimeters);\ne) using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes\nauthenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual\ninformation such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the\nuser endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12);\nf)\nalways authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information\nsystems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities\n(5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing\nstrong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5).\nThe established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced\ndevelopment of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the\norganization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure\nthat suppliers’ security engineering practices align with the organization’s needs.\nThe security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly\nreviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within\nthe engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to-\ndate in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the\ntechnologies and solutions being applied.\n\n",
      "Other information": "Secure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques,\nsuch as:\n— fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;\n— segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);\n— tamper resistance.\nSecure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on\nthe same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that\ninstance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data.\nTamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether\nphysical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that\nthere is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the\nsuccessful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).",

Additionally, such processes\nand governance should be extended to cover software components from third parties and open source\nsoftware.\nThe organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software\nvulnerabilities to guide the organization’s secure coding principles through continual improvement and\nlearning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the\nfast-changing threat landscape.\nPlanning and before coding\nSecure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These\nprinciples should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products\nand services supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites before coding should\ninclude:\na) organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both\nin-house and outsourced code developments;\nb) common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities;\n\b\n\b\n\nc)\nconfiguring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce\nthe creation of secure code;\nd) following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and execution environments as\napplicable;\ne) maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);\nf)\nqualification of developers in writing secure code;\ng) secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;\nh) secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;\ni)\nuse of controlled environments for development.\nDuring coding\nConsiderations during coding should include:\na) secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used;\nb) using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming, refactoring, peer review,\nsecurity iterations and test-driven development;\nc)\nusing structured programming techniques;\nd) documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow information security\nvulnerabilities to be exploited;\ne) prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved\ncode samples and unauthenticated web services).\nTesting should be conducted during and after development (see 8.29). Static application security testing\n(SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.\nBefore software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:\na) attack surface and the principle of least privilege;\nb) conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have\nbeen mitigated.\nReview and maintenance\nAfter code has been made operational:\na) updates should be securely packaged and deployed;\nb) reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8);\nc)\nerrors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to\nthe code as necessary;\nd) source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using\nconfiguration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and\nversion control).\nIf using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:\na) ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used\nand their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;\n\n\nb) selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and\ncryptographic components;\nc)\nthe licence, security and history of external components;\nd) ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;\ne) sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.\nWhere a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:\na) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;\nb) whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;\nc)\nthe possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;\nd) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a\nresult of changes;\ne) compatibility with other software in use.",

      "Guidance": "The level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary\nto prevent production problems should be identified and implemented.\nThe following items should be considered:\na) adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different\ndomains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments);\nb) defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software\nfrom development to production status;\nc)\ntesting changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to\nbeing applied to production systems (see 8.29);\nd) not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and\napproved;\ne) compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from\nproduction systems when not required;\nf)\ndisplaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error;\ng) not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless\nequivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems.\nIn all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering:\na) patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders,\nintegrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries);\nb) secure configuration of systems and software;\nc)\ncontrol of access to the environments;\nd) monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\ne) secure monitoring of the environments;\nf)\ntaking backups of the environments.\nA single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without\nprior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights\nor through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed\nlogging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized\nchanges.\n\n",
      "Other information": "Without adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production\nsystems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment,\nsystem failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of\nconfidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable\nenvironment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to\nthe production environment.\nMeasures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing\nsegregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place.\nDevelopment and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information.\nDevelopment and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they\nshare the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments\nis therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production\nsoftware and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information).\nIn some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be\ndeliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled\nrollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can\noccur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live\ndeployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any\none time.\nSupporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33)\nare necessary.\nOrganizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when\nconducting end user training.",
