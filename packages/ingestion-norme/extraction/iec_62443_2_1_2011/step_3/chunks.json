        "description": "Physical and environmental security measures should be designed to complement the cyber security measures taken to protect assets that are part of the IACS and coordinated with the physical security of the remainder of the plant. When developing a program for physical security of assets, it is important to include all systems in the scope and not just limit the effort to traditional computer room facilities. Practical engineering judgment should be used to balance the risks when determining physical security procedures. Physical segmentation is a key security countermeasure designed to compartmentalize devices into security zones where identified security practices are employed to achieve the desired target security level.",
        "objective": "Create a secure environment for the protection of IACS assets. An asset is any physical or logical object owned by, or under the custodial duties of, an organization, having either a perceived or actual value to the organization (see IEC/TS 62443‑1‑1). IACS assets are those 62443-2-1 Ó IEC:2010(E) assets that are a part of the IACS, either physical or cyber or that can affect the operation of the IACS. Physical security measures ensure that all assets, specifically those related to the IACS of an organization, are protected physically from unauthorized access, loss, damage, misuse, and the like. Environmental security measures ensure that the assets of an organization are protected against environmental conditions that would make them unusable or damage the information they contain.",
        "rationale": "Physical assets are a means to an end as well as the end itself. In modern control systems the physical assets provide the means by which the cyber system operates. Therefore, the asset has value in itself but also has value as an integral part of the control system. Since both the asset and the control system require each other, both shall be protected in order for the system to be secure. The overriding security premise is that the use of security countermeasures should be commensurate with the level of risk. While physical segmentation is an important security countermeasure employed in conjunction with other layers of defense to reduce the risk that may be associated with IACS, it may not be necessary if the security risks are within accepted limits.",
