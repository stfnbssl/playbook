When developing a program for physical security of assets, it is important to include all systems in the scope and not just limit the effort to traditional computer room facilities. Practical engineering judgment should be used to balance the risks when determining physical security procedures. Physical segmentation is a key security countermeasure designed to compartmentalize devices into security zones where identified security practices are employed to achieve the desired target security level.",

An asset is any physical or logical object owned by, or under the custodial duties of, an organization, having either a perceived or actual value to the organization (see IEC/TS 62443‑1‑1). IACS assets are those 62443-2-1 Ó IEC:2010(E) assets that are a part of the IACS, either physical or cyber or that can affect the operation of the IACS. Physical security measures ensure that all assets, specifically those related to the IACS of an organization, are protected physically from unauthorized access, loss, damage, misuse, and the like. Environmental security measures ensure that the assets of an organization are protected against environmental conditions that would make them unusable or damage the information they contain.",
          "rationale": "Physical assets are a means to an end as well as the end itself. In modern control systems the physical assets provide the means by which the cyber system operates. Therefore, the asset has value in itself but also has value as an integral part of the control system. Since both the asset and the control system require each other, both shall be protected in order for the system to be secure. The overriding security premise is that the use of security countermeasures should be commensurate with the level of risk. While physical segmentation is an important security countermeasure employed in conjunction with other layers of defense to reduce the risk that may be associated with IACS, it may not be necessary if the security risks are within accepted limits.",

There are three key aspects associated with access control: account administration, authentication and authorization. All three aspects shall work together to establish a sound and secure access control strategy. There are several types of authentication strategies and each has varying degrees of strength. Strong authentication methods are ones that are quite accurate in positively identifying the user. Weak authentication methods are ones that can be easily defeated to provide unwanted access to information. Physical location of the user may have a significant impact on the risk of accessing the IACS.",

          "rationale": "Authentication requirements are more stringent for administration/configuration users and remote users, than for other users. This is because administration/configuration users have broader privileges and their actions have potentially more impact than other users; and remote users are typically not subject to complementary physical access controls. Automatic account lockout due to failed logins or periods of inactivity increases authentication strength, but is considered carefully in the IACS environment, since failure to authenticate a valid user could have HSE implications if the user is not able to perform tasks in a critical situation. In the IACS environment, there is a great emphasis on combining physical authentication measures with electronic authentication practices.",
