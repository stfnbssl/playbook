Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are
members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical
committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical
activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the
work.
The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance
are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria
needed for the different types of document should be noted. This document was drafted in

 Introduction
 0.1 General
 This document has been prepared to provide requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining
 and continually improving an information security management system. The adoption of an
 information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment
 and implementation of an organization’s information security management system is influenced by the
 organization’s needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the
 size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.
 The information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability
 of information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that
 risks are adequately managed.
 It is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the
 organization’s processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered
 in the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security
 management system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.
 This document can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organization's ability to meet
 the organization’s own information security requirements.
 The order in which requirements are presented in this document does not reflect their importance
 or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference
 purpose only.
 ISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management
 systems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including
 ISO/IEC 27003[2], ISO/IEC 27004[3] and ISO/IEC 27005[4]), with related terms and definitions.
 0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards
 This document applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, common terms,
 and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO Supplement,
 and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the
 Annex SL.
 This common approach defined in the Annex SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to
 operate a single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system
 standards.
