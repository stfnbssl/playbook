For potentially hazardous processes, the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and functional safety assessments as defined in IEC 61511-2 [8] should be referenced as part of the initial cyber security risk assessment to identify worst-case impacts. Organizations should also take into consideration threat intelligence from governments, sector specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and other relevant sources.

For example, a facility might first be divided into operational areas, such as materials storage, processing, finishing, etc. Operational areas can often be further divided into functional layers, such as manufacturing execution systems (MESs), supervisory systems (for example, human machine interfaces [HMIs]), primary control systems (for example, BPCS, DCS, remote terminal units [RTUs] and programmable logic controllers [PLCs]) and safety systems.

A common method of estimating likelihood is to use a semi-quantitative likelihood scale that is defined by the organization as part of their risk management system (refer to Annex B for examples). Either qualitative or quantitative methods are allowed by this document. A number of factors are considered when estimating unmitigated likelihood such as the motivation and capability of the threat source, the history of similar threats, known vulnerabilities, the attractiveness of the target, etc. Existing cyber security countermeasures for the zone or conduit being evaluated should not be considered when determining unmitigated likelihood; they should be hypothetically eliminated. However, the likelihood determination recognizes countermeasures that are inherent to IACS components and any non-cyber independent protection layers (IPLs) such as physical security, mechanical safeguards (such as, pressure safety valves) or emergency procedures that are in place to reduce the likelihood. Likelihood is evaluated twice during the detailed risk assessment process. It is initially determined without consideration for any existing countermeasures in order to establish the unmitigated risk. It will be re-evaluated in 4.6.10, taking into account existing countermeasures and their effectiveness in order to determine residual risk. Consequence-only risk assessment methodologies may be used to meet the requirements of this document. These methodologies typically do not factor likelihood into the determination of unmitigated cyber risk and implicitly assume that likelihood is constant (such as, assuming the likelihood is ever present or quantitatively a ‘1’).",

      "rationale": "It is important to characterize and document the attributes of a zone or conduit. Each of the items listed in the above requirements has a specific purpose, as described below: a) Name and/or unique identifier – It is important for design and documentation purposes to be able to uniquely identify each zone or conduit. b) Accountable organization(s) – The accountable organization is the person, group or groups who are responsible and accountable for the security of the zone or conduit. NOTE The accountable and responsible organizations can be different. If so, they will both be identified. c) Logical boundary – The logical boundary is important because it delineates the boundary between the zone or conduit and the rest of the system. It also helps identify the demarcation point for all communications entering or exiting the zone or conduit. d) Physical boundary – It is important to document the physical boundary if the zone or conduit requires physical security to achieve its SL-T. If physical security could enhance (but is not required) the SL-T, it should preferably be documented. e) Safety Designation – It is important to identify if the zone or conduit is safety related or contains safety related assets. f) List of logical access points – Logical access points are any place where electronic information can cross the logical boundary of a zone or conduit. Logical access points need to be identified and documented as they may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats. g) List of physical access points – Physical access points (for example, fences, doors and enclosures) are any place where personnel can gain physical access to zone or conduit assets. Physical access points need to be identified and documented to determine appropriate means of monitoring and preventing unauthorized access. h) List of data flows – In order to detect anomalies, it is important to identify and document the expected flow of data (for example, source, destination and protocol) throughout the system and, in particular, the flow of data in and out of a zone or conduit. i) Connected zones or conduits – It is important to identify the connectivity between zones and conduits in order to identify all of the logical access points into and within the system. Typically, this is illustrated in a zone and conduit diagram. j) List of assets and their classification, criticality and business value – It is important to identify the IACS assets contained within each zone or conduit and their classification, criticality and business value in order to develop an understanding of the consequences should that zone or conduit be compromised. When identifying consequences, it is important to consider the consequences to other zones/conduits as well as the zone/conduit in question. k) SL-T – The SL-T communicates the level of protection required for a zone or conduit based upon the results of the risk assessment. Refer to 4.6.7 for further information. l) Applicable security requirements – For each zone and conduit it is necessary to identify the applicable security requirements needed to achieve the SL-T. Some requirements may be common to all zones or conduits in the SUC while others may be specific. NOTE Security requirements specification cannot be finalized until after completion of the detailed risk assessment (refer to 4.6). m) Applicable security policies – For each zone and conduit, it is necessary to identify the applicable organizational security policies needed to achieve the SL-T. Some policies may be common to all zones or conduits in the SUC while others may be specific. n) Assumptions and external dependencies – Oftentimes, the security of a zone or conduit is dependent upon factors outside of the zone or conduit, such as clean power and additional layers of physical and network security. These assumptions and interdependencies should be documented.",
