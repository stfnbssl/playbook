                                              505.1
(C) Connection to Grounding Electrodes. Where connection
to a grounding electrode is required, the grounding electrode shall
be as specified in 250.52(A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), and (A)(4) and
shall comply with 250.30(A)(4). Sections 250.52(A)(5), (A)(7),
and (A)(8) shall not be used if any of the electrodes specified in
250.52(A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4) are present.
Where a grounding electrode is necessary for associated appara
tus. the electrodes specified in 250.52(A)(1) through (A)(4)
(metal underground water pipes, metal in-ground support struc
tures, concrete-encased electrodes, and ground rings) are
required to be used if present. These electrodes usually provide
lower resistance grounds than ground rods and plate electrodes,
which are covered in 250.52(A)(5) and (A)(7).

might be required
504.60 Bonding.
(A) Intrinsically Safe Apparatus. Intrinsically safe apparatus,
if of metal, shall be bonded in the hazardous (classified) location
in accordance with 501.30(B), 502.30(B), 503.30(B), 505.30(3),
or 5(M-30(B), as applicable.
(B) Metal Raceways. Where metal raceways are used for
intrinsically safe system wiring, bonding at all ends of the
raceway, regardless of the location, shall be in accordance with
501.30(B), 502.30(B), 503.30(B), 505.30(B), or 506.30(B), as
applicable.
504.70 Sealing. Conduits and cables that are required to be
sealed by 501.15, 502.15, 505.16, and 506.16 shall be sealed
to minimize the passage of gases, vapors, or dusts. Such seals
shall not be required to be explosionproof or flameproof but
shall be identified for the purpose of minimizing passage of
gases, vapors, or dusts under normal operating conditions and
shall be accessible.
Exception: Seals shall not be required for enclosures that con
tain only intrinsically safe apparatus, except as required by
501.17.
The use of an IS system does not remove the need to seal inter
connecting cables. Any cable capable of transmitting material to
another location must be sealed. These seals are not required
to be explosionproof or flameproof, but they must be identified to
minimize the passage of gases or dust and must be accessible.
504.80 IdentiBcation. Labels required by this section shall
be suitable for the environment where they are installed, with
consideration given to exposure to chemicals and sunlight.
(A) Terminals. Intrinsically safe circuits shall be identified at
terminal and junction locations in a manner that is intended to
prevent unintentional interference with the circuits during test
ing and servicing.
                        (B) Wiring. Raceways, cable trays, and other wiring methods
                        for intrinsically safe system wiring shall be identified with per
                        manently affixed labels with the wording "Intrinsic Safety Wir
                        ing" or equivalent. The labels shall be located so as to be visible
                        after installation and placed so that they may be readily traced
                        through the entire length of the installation. Intrinsic safety circuit
                        labels shall appear in every section of the wiring system that is
                        separated by enclosures, walls, partitions, or floors. Spacing
                        between labels shall not be more than 7.5 m (25 ft).
                        Exception: Circuits run underground shall be permitted to be
                          identified where they become accessible after emergence from
                        the ground.
                          Informational Note No. 1: Wiring methods permitted in unclas
                          sified locations may be used for intrinsically safe systems in
                          hazardous (classified) locations. Without labels to identify the
                          application of the wiring, enforcement authorities cannot deter
                          mine that an installation is in compliance with this Code.
                          Informational Note No. 2: In unclassified locations, identification
                          is necessary to ensure that nonintrinsically safe wire will not be
                          inadvertently added to existing raceways at a later date.
                        (C) Color Coding. Color coding shall be permitted to identify
                        intrinsically safe conductoi^ where they are colored light blue and
                        where no other conductors colored light blue are used. Likewise,
                        color coding shall be permitted to identify raceways, cable trays,
                        and junction boxes where they are colored light blue and contain
                        only intrinsically safe wiring.
