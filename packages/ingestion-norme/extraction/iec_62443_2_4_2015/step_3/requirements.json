      "Rationale": "The capabilities specified by this BR and its RE are used to limit access to the Automation Solution by removing/disabling unnecessary features and preventing unauthorized access to different types of\nAutomation Solution interfaces (e.g. network device and configuration/diagnostic ports).\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for reducing the attack surface of the Automation Solution, for limiting access to the listed interfaces/ports to authorized users, and for maintaining the hardened state of the Automation Solution. This process may include the use of network security tools described in SP.02.02 BR and its REs.\nLimiting the software applications and their associated communication access points, USB devices such as mass storage devices, and wireless communications capabilities to only those necessary to perform the functions of a device used in both normal and emergency operations reduces the number of avenues into the device for an attack. Identifying unnecessary and/or unauthorized access points (e.g. using network scanning tools) is one technique that can be used to discover unnecessary software programs.\nIdentifying network addresses that are unauthorized, for example using network scans as described in SP.02.02 RE(2), and removing them (e.g. by disconnecting the devices to which they are assigned) limits the source of passive and active attacks.\nControlling access to physical configuration ports of devices, such as serial ports is intended to prevent or reduce the risk of having the network configuration (network devices) or the operation of other devices changed without proper authorization. Different methods for controlling access include installing a device in a locked cabinet, being able to physically lock the configuration port, or otherwise disabling use of the port when its use is not authorized (e.g. through a software lock).\nLocking down network device ports (switches and routers) reduces the possibility that an unauthorized device will be able to connect to the network and launch attacks or sniff the network.\nControl system products may have already removed capabilities unused by them prior to or during installation, making it necessary for the service provider to ensure that they are added/enabled only if they are required and approved by the asset owner.\nMaintenance processes provide the possibility that previously hardened components of the\nAutomation Solution are reset or reconfigured to lose some aspect of their hardening. Controlling these processes reduce this possibility."

      "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that there are manual and/or automated controls in place to prevent Automation Solution devices, such as controllers, from executing invalid and/or unauthorized commands.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for ensuring that all commands (e.g. writes to setpoints, configuration commands) sent to Automation Solution devices (e.g. from workstations) are valid (within authorized limits), are authorized by a user with the appropriate permissions, and are transferred to the device executing the command (e.g. controller) over a connection that has been designated/authorized to be used for this purpose (e.g. a connection from an Operator Console to a controller).\nThe intent of the second item of the requirement is to make sure that commands can only be requested by authorized users (e.g. operators), that the entity receiving and executing the command knows which connections are authorized for receiving commands, and that the command is checked for validity. Validity is normally value and state dependent. For example, a setpoint normally is not allowed to be written by the operator without putting the loop into manual control. This requirement also requires the service provider to have an identifiable process for ensuring that data flows are conducted over an authorized connection and that the data is transferred in the authorized direction. The intent of this portion of the requirement is make sure that the flow of data, including the direction, is authorized and conducted over authorized connections.\nFor example, if a dynamic change (not a configuration change) to a set point is initiated by an entity not explicitly authorized to make the change, such as an advanced control application, then the system will notify the operator of the change and the operator is required to approve it before it can take effect. If the operator does not approve it, the set point does not change.\nNOTE 1 This requirement generally applies to commands issued by workstations and sent to controllers, and not to commands sent from controllers to Level 1 devices.\nNOTE 2 Authorization of connections may be performed automatically by the control system and/or through appropriate configuration by the service provider (setting up network addresses/ports authorized to send commands.\nNOTE 3 Risk assessments (see IEC 62443-3-2) can be used to determine which connections are authorized to perform control actions. If warranted by the risk assessment, \"dual approval\" system capabilities (see IEC 62443-3-3) can be used to support this requirement. Dual approval refers to the system requiring two people to authorize actions that can result in serious impact to the IACS.\nNOTE 4 \"Initiated or approved by\" means, for example, that the Automation Solution can prevent remote operators from changing setpoints without approval by the local operator through the authorized connection. How this is implemented is Automation Solution dependent."

Incident handling implementation may be controlled by specific agreements between the asset owner and service provider, such as non-disclosure agreements and/or other contractual vehicles between the asset owner and service provider. These contractual vehicles often identify proprietary data to be protected and the types of compromise that to be reported.\nTypically, the process of identifying incidents includes (1) event analysis and correlation, and (2) examination and triage of resulting compromises and potential incidents to yield incidents. SP.03.03 BR addresses handling of vulnerabilities that may have been exposed by this process or by other processes. In many cases, recognition that a compromise has occurred and that an associated loss has resulted can be difficult and may involve subjectivity and judgment. The specification of this process and the precise definition of what constitutes an incident is beyond the scope of these requirements.\nFor requirements related to product development incident reporting and handling that can complement the service provider's incident handling capabilities, see IEC 62443-4-1 and ISO/IEC 30111."

      "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to verify that:\n1) it is possible to perform a complete back-up of the Automation Solution, and\n2) it is possible to restore a fully functioning Automation Solution from this back-up.",
      "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that the backup and restore capabilities for the Automation Solution work as intended.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for demonstrating or otherwise verifying that a backup can be performed successfully and that the Automation Solution can be restored from this backup. This process should be flexible to allow the asset owner to request only a partial backup/restore to gain confidence that the backup capability can be used successfully.\nIf the backup includes the backup of data bases, then having this capability also means that the service provider has an identifiable process for demonstrating or otherwise verifying that automatic rollback is stopped/disabled prior to starting the backup. Automatic rollback can cause inconsistencies in the data base should it occur while the data base is being backed up."
