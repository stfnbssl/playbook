Validity is normally value and state dependent. For example, a setpoint normally is not allowed to be written by the operator without putting the loop into manual control. This requirement also requires the service provider to have an identifiable process for ensuring that data flows are conducted over an authorized connection and that the data is transferred in the authorized direction. The intent of this portion of the requirement is make sure that the flow of data, including the direction, is authorized and conducted over authorized connections.\nFor example, if a dynamic change (not a configuration change) to a set point is initiated by an entity not explicitly authorized to make the change, such as an advanced control application, then the system will notify the operator of the change and the operator is required to approve it before it can take effect. If the operator does not approve it, the set point does not change.\nNOTE 1 This requirement generally applies to commands issued by workstations and sent to controllers, and not to commands sent from controllers to Level 1 devices.\nNOTE 2 Authorization of connections may be performed automatically by the control system and/or through appropriate configuration by the service provider (setting up network addresses/ports authorized to send commands.\nNOTE 3 Risk assessments (see IEC 62443-3-2) can be used to determine which connections are authorized to perform control actions. If warranted by the risk assessment, \"dual approval\" system capabilities (see IEC 62443-3-3) can be used to support this requirement. Dual approval refers to the system requiring two people to authorize actions that can result in serious impact to the IACS.\nNOTE 4 \"Initiated or approved by\" means, for example, that the Automation Solution can prevent remote operators from changing setpoints without approval by the local operator through the authorized connection.
