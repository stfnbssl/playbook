    "Topic": "Backup",
    "Subtopic": "Robustness",
    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to ensure that the Automation Solution is able to continue normal operation during a backup.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that operation of the Automation Solution (e.g. control of the process) is not impacted by the backup process. Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for ensuring that the backup operations do not interfere with normal operations of the Automation Solution. For related system capability requirements, see IEC 62443-3-3."

    "Topic": "Manual process",
    "Subtopic": "Logging",
    "Doc": "Yes",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to provide documentation to the asset owner that describes how to generate and maintain audit logs of all backup and restore activities.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that the asset owner knows how to manage audit logs for the backup and restore operations. These audit logs provide evidence of backup/restore activities such as when they occurred, who performed them, and their status. Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for preparing or providing documentation that describes how to configure the Automation Solution to write backup and restore actions to an audit log."

    "BR_RE": "BR",
    "Functional_area": "Backup/Restore",
    "Topic": "Manual process",
    "Subtopic": "Disaster recovery",
    "Doc": "Yes",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to document a recommended disaster recovery plan that includes, but is not limited to the following:\n1) Description of various disaster scenarios and their impact on the Automation Solution,\n2) Step-by-step instructions for restoring, restarting, failed components and integrating them into the Automation Solution,\n3) Minimum architecture requirement for restoring the entire Automation Solution.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that not only there is a plan for recovering from a disaster, but also that the details of how a disaster could occur (e.g. including cyber-security threats), and how to recover from the disaster.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for preparing a document specific to the Automation Solution that defines how to manage a major crisis based on a cyber-security scenario for restoring the Automation Solution and its components.\nThe back-up and the means of restoration cannot be compromised by loss of the Automation Solution components or the entire Automation Solution. The means of restoration may include equipment, such as test bench or off-line development tools."
