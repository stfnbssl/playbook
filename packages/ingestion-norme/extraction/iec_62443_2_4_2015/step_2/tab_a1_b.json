    "Rationale": "The capabilities specified by this BR and its RE are used to ensure that the Automation Solution's access controls (including authentication mechanisms) are always used to prevent unauthorized access to the Automation Solution's field devices from workstations/handhelds.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for ensuring that there are no direct paths between workstations/handhelds and control/instrumentation devices that bypass the control system's access controls. The assumption is that access controls to these devices by engineers and operators is built into the control system. However, maintenance or engineering may be done using handhelds or other workstations that are not tightly integrated with the control system, and this required capability ensures that they cannot directly connect to control/instrumentation devices, bypassing the control system's access controls."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to support the use of multi- factor authentication for Automation Solution workstations as required by the asset owner. This requirement applies only to the workstations for which the service provider is responsible.",
    "Rationale": "Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for using multi-factor authentication in workstations as required by the asset owner. This support may include the ability to supply the necessary hardware and/or set up workstations to enforce multi-factor authentication. In practice, the type and level of authentication used for workstations will be defined by the site security requirements, which are often the result of a risk assessment (see IEC 62443-3- 2).\nIn general, multi-factor authentication is used for workstations that are accessible by personnel who are not authorized users of the Automation Solution, such as workstations that are normally unattended and/or in uncontrolled spaces. This requirement only applies to workstations for which the service provider is responsible.\nMulti-factor authentication includes, at a minimum, at least two of the following:\n1) something the user knows, such as a password,\n2) something the user possesses (a physical token), such as a smart card,\n3) something inherent about the user, such as a retinal scan\n4) someplace you are."

    "Rationale": "This BR and its REs recognize that network devices are critical to the Automation Solution, and as a result, are often the subject of attack. Therefore, this BR and its administration of network devices for REs are defined to ensure that the various facets of network device administration are protected.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for applying the concept of least privilege to the administration of network devices. Least privilege for administrative operations means that access is granted only to resources (e.g. directories and files) that are needed and operating system privileges are similarly restricted to only those that are needed."

However, if the asset owner's operating procedures allow access to the network devices by administrators and others, then multiple roles can be defined.",
    "Rationale": "Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for configuring network devices to use role-based access controls. Defining separate roles allows separate access control lists to be defined for each role, thus supporting the concept of least privilege.\nNormally, network devices are accessed only by administrators so only one role needs to be defined and the access control list to be set accordingly. However, if the asset owner's operating procedures provide for different levels of network device administration, then multiple roles need to be defined. Users capable of administering network devices will then be granted these roles.\nSee IEC 62351-8 for further discussion of role based access controls."

    "Rationale": "Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for configuring network devices to use mutual authentication. Mutual authentication validates the identity of the user and the network device, and results in the ability of the network device to determine whether the user is authorized to access the device, and in the ability for the user to ensure the device is the intended device and is not being spoofed. Challenge/response, user password/device certificate, and Kerberos (RFC 1510), are examples of techniques used to provide mutual authentication."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to ensure that the Automation Solution is configured to verify that all control actions and data flows in the Automation Solution (e.g. between workstations and controllers), including configuration changes, are:\n1) valid,\n2) initiated or approved by an authorized user, and\n3) transferred over an approved connection in the approved direction.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that there are manual and/or automated controls in place to prevent Automation Solution devices, such as controllers, from executing invalid and/or unauthorized commands.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for ensuring that all commands (e.g. writes to setpoints, configuration commands) sent to Automation Solution devices (e.g. from workstations) are valid (within authorized limits), are authorized by a user with the appropriate permissions, and are transferred to the device executing the command (e.g. controller) over a connection that has been designated/authorized to be used for this purpose (e.g. a connection from an Operator Console to a controller).\nThe intent of the second item of the requirement is to make sure that commands can only be requested by authorized users (e.g. operators), that the entity receiving and executing the command knows which connections are authorized for receiving commands, and that the command is checked for validity. Validity is normally value and state dependent. For example, a setpoint normally is not allowed to be written by the operator without putting the loop into manual control. This requirement also requires the service provider to have an identifiable process for ensuring that data flows are conducted over an authorized connection and that the data is transferred in the authorized direction. The intent of this portion of the requirement is make sure that the flow of data, including the direction, is authorized and conducted over authorized connections.\nFor example, if a dynamic change (not a configuration change) to a set point is initiated by an entity not explicitly authorized to make the change, such as an advanced control application, then the system will notify the operator of the change and the operator is required to approve it before it can take effect. If the operator does not approve it, the set point does not change.\nNOTE 1 This requirement generally applies to commands issued by workstations and sent to controllers, and not to commands sent from controllers to Level 1 devices.\nNOTE 2 Authorization of connections may be performed automatically by the control system and/or through appropriate configuration by the service provider (setting up network addresses/ports authorized to send commands.\nNOTE 3 Risk assessments (see IEC 62443-3-2) can be used to determine which connections are authorized to perform control actions. If warranted by the risk assessment, \"dual approval\" system capabilities (see IEC 62443-3-3) can be used to support this requirement. Dual approval refers to the system requiring two people to authorize actions that can result in serious impact to the IACS.\nNOTE 4 \"Initiated or approved by\" means, for example, that the Automation Solution can prevent remote operators from changing setpoints without approval by the local operator through the authorized connection. How this is implemented is Automation Solution dependent."

    "Rationale": "The capabilities specified by this BR and its REs are used to ensure that data stored and/or transferred in the Automation Solution that needs protection is documented and adequately protected. Typically both the asset owner and the service provider collaborate to identify control system data that needs protection (e.g. passwords, certificates, keys) and other data deemed worthy of protection by the asset owner (e.g. recipes). Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for identifying the data within the Automation Solution, either at rest or in transit, that requires protection and the type of protection required. The definition of data requiring safeguarding often contains site-specific criteria, and therefore, the asset owner should provide or at least approve the criteria. Data at rest can be in memory or in a storage device, and data in transit is data that is being transferred from one entity to another (a data flow).\nExamples of the types of data to be protected include (this list is not exhaustive):\n1) legal or regulatory information\n2) asset owner confidential data, including proprietary data (e.g. recipes) and data identified in NDAs or other contractual vehicles\n3) configuration and operational data (e.g. commands and parameters)\n4) system data, such as cryptographic materials (e.g. keys and certificates), access control lists,\npasswords, network device data,\n5) audit and event logs,\n6) backup data,\n7) historical data,\n8) data warehouses."

    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to reduce the possibility that the SIS EWS will contain software that could intentionally or inadvertently cause harm to the SIS.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for ensuring that SIS engineering workstations are dedicated to SIS and are not used as workstations for other purposes within the control system."

    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to verify that wireless devices are not allowed as an integral part of SIS safety functions.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to prevent wireless attacks against the SIS since wireless devices are not bounded by physical security perimeters nor by physical implementation. For example, if a workstation/server class machine resides outside the physical security perimeter and is configured with a wireless device interface and is able to connect to the wireless device network, it will pose a threat to the SIS. Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for verifying that that wireless device communications are not used within the SIS."

    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to ensure that the Automation Solution provides a user interface for enabling and disabling SIS configuration mode. While locked, this interface shall prohibit the SIS from being configured. NOTE This interface will typically prevent configuration messages from being delivered to the SIS.",
    "Rationale": "The capabilities specified by this BR and its REs are used to prevent configuration access to the SIS during normal operation through a mechanism that requires the SIS to be unlocked to configure it, and locked at all other times.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider is able to ensure that the SIS can be locked to prevent configuration changes from being made and unlocked to allow them to be made. Locks can be physical key switches or software controlled locks, but however implemented they allow the SIS to be locked to prevent inadvertent or malicious changes from being made."

    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to ensure that the Automation Solution provides a hardware implementation of the interface required by SP.05.09 BR and that this hardware interface is capable of being physically locked while configuration mode is disabled.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this RE is defined to require intentional human intervention to enable configuration of the SIS, such as holding a physical key open (unlocked) while the configuration is being changed, for the purpose of increasing confidence that inadvertent changes to the SIS configuration cannot occur.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider is able to ensure that the SIS has a hardware interface that can be disabled to prevent configuration changes from being made. The hardware interface, such as a physical key switch, when physically locked (e.g. removing the key), configuration mode is disabled."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to have an independent 3rd party verify that it is not possible to change the configuration of the SIS when the hardware interface described in SP.05.09 RE(1) is locked in the \"disable\" configuration mode.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this RE is defined to add an additional level of confidence that the physical locking mechanism works as intended.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for providing a report from a 3rd party that verifies that the SIS configuration locking mechanism works.\nThis report may be initiated (e.g. contracted) by the control system supplier for the Automation Solution or by the service provider. This verification may occur prior to delivery of the product to the Automation Solution (as part of product verification) or after delivery of the hardware interface (as part of the service provider's its Automation Solution activities)."
