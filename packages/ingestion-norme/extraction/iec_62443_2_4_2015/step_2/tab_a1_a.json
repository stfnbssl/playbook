These capabilities shall address:\n1) The handling of vulnerabilities newly discovered in the Automation Solution or in its related policies and procedures for which the service provider is responsible, and\n2) The handling of publically disclosed vulnerabilities affecting the Automation Solution.",
    "Rationale": "Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for assessing, reporting, and disposing of (e.g. recommending mitigations, preparing remediation plans) vulnerabilities related to the Automation Solution components for which the service provider is responsible.\nTypically, the process of identifying vulnerabilities includes event analysis and correlation (see SP.08.01 BR), risk assessment (see SP.03.01 BR and its REs), network scans and other automated methods (see SP.02.02 BR and its REs), and assurance (see SP.02.01 BR). Software patches that result from the disposition of vulnerabilities are considered to be security patches."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to provide documentation to the asset owner that describes how to mitigate security weaknesses inherent in the design and/or implementation of communication protocols used in the Automation Solution that were known prior to Automation Solution integration or maintenance activities.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that compensating mechanisms are used to address weaknesses in Automation Solution communications.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for informing the asset owner about known communication weaknesses in the Automation Solution and how to mitigate them. For example, if the Automation Solution uses unencrypted protocols for the transfer of sensitive data, then the service provider should recommend security measures, such as lockable switches and physical security for communication links, to protect transmission of the data. NOTE The asset owner may also require the service provider, as part of its service agreement with the service provider or via a separate service agreement, to inform the asset owner of the discovery of additional weaknesses/mitigations discovered after the normal term of integration or maintenance activities."

    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that timestamps are used in the Automation Solution and that they are generated and distributed from a reliable source. Timestamps are used in forensics when examining event logs.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for integrating a network time source into the Automation Solution. The ability to provide the time source is not within the scope of this requirement. However, whether or not the service provider provides the time source, it is the responsibility of the service provider to integrate the time source into the Automation Solution. An example of a commonly accepted time source protocol IEEE 1588-2008/IEC 61588:2009."

    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to ensure that only software and hardware features required by the Automation Solution or approved by the asset owner are enabled in the Automation Solution.\nAt a minimum, this includes ensuring that:\n1) unnecessary software applications and services (e.g. email, office applications, games) and their associated communication access points (e.g. TCP/UDP ports), USB devices (e.g. mass storage), Bluetooth and wireless communications are disabled and/or removed unless required by the Automation Solution. 2) network addresses in use are authorized,\n3) physical and logical access to diagnostic and configuration ports is protected from unauthorized access and use.\n4) unused ports on network devices (e.g. switches and routers) are configured to prevent unauthorized access to the Automation Solution's network infrastructure.\n5) maintenance processes maintain the hardened state of the Automation Solution during its lifetime.",
    "Rationale": "The capabilities specified by this BR and its RE are used to limit access to the Automation Solution by removing/disabling unnecessary features and preventing unauthorized access to different types of\nAutomation Solution interfaces (e.g. network device and configuration/diagnostic ports).\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for reducing the attack surface of the Automation Solution, for limiting access to the listed interfaces/ports to authorized users, and for maintaining the hardened state of the Automation Solution. This process may include the use of network security tools described in SP.02.02 BR and its REs.\nLimiting the software applications and their associated communication access points, USB devices such as mass storage devices, and wireless communications capabilities to only those necessary to perform the functions of a device used in both normal and emergency operations reduces the number of avenues into the device for an attack. Identifying unnecessary and/or unauthorized access points (e.g. using network scanning tools) is one technique that can be used to discover unnecessary software programs.\nIdentifying network addresses that are unauthorized, for example using network scans as described in SP.02.02 RE(2), and removing them (e.g. by disconnecting the devices to which they are assigned) limits the source of passive and active attacks.\nControlling access to physical configuration ports of devices, such as serial ports is intended to prevent or reduce the risk of having the network configuration (network devices) or the operation of other devices changed without proper authorization. Different methods for controlling access include installing a device in a locked cabinet, being able to physically lock the configuration port, or otherwise disabling use of the port when its use is not authorized (e.g. through a software lock).\nLocking down network device ports (switches and routers) reduces the possibility that an unauthorized device will be able to connect to the network and launch attacks or sniff the network.\nControl system products may have already removed capabilities unused by them prior to or during installation, making it necessary for the service provider to ensure that they are added/enabled only if they are required and approved by the asset owner.\nMaintenance processes provide the possibility that previously hardened components of the\nAutomation Solution are reset or reconfigured to lose some aspect of their hardening. Controlling these processes reduce this possibility."

    "Requirement": "The service provider's hardening guidelines and procedures shall ensure that only necessary, authorized, and documented digital certificates for certificate authorities (CAs) are installed.",
    "Rationale": "Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for determining which CA certificates are installed and removing those that are not used/authorized.\nTypically operating system installation and upgrades cause a generic set of Certificate Authority certificates to be installed, even though they are not required for the Automation Solution. Limiting which CA certificates are installed to only those that are necessary prevents authentication of unwanted, undesirable, or unnecessary applications."

    "Doc": "No",
    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to support the use of session locking for Automation Solution workstations as required by the asset owner. This requirement applies only to the workstations for which the service provider is responsible. Session locking:\n1) prevents information on the logged on user's display device from being viewed, and\n2) blocks input from the user's input device (e.g. keyboard, mouse) until unlocked by the session user or an administrator.\nNOTE Locking the user input device means that the user at the workstation is not able to use the keyboard except for unlocking the keyboard.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that workstations can be locked to protect against disclosure of information on the user's display device (e.g. screen) and against use of the user input device (e.g. keyboard, mouse).\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for enabling automatic screen locking for workstations, as required by the asset owner. Automatic screen locking causes the workstation screen to stop displaying and prevents data input until the authorized logged-on user unlocks the screen, typically by reentering the password. Which workstations need automatic screen locking enabled is defined by the site security requirements, which are often the result of a risk assessment (see IEC 62443-3-2). For example, workstations used to administer network devices and wireless networks are normally unattended and in accessible locations and therefore require automatic session locking enabled. This requirement only applies to workstations for which the service provider is responsible."
