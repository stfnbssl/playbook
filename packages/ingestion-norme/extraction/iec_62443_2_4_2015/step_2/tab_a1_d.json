To change these passwords, the asset owner may require the service provider's support.\nSimilarly, if service provider personnel share passwords with others, the service provider will need to report these accounts/passwords to the asset owner when they no longer need to be shared. Sharing of passwords often occurs during testing, commissioning, troubleshooting, and maintenance.\nIn addition, any time the service provider suspects that a password has been compromised, it should notify the account owner and request that the password be changed."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to provide documented instructions to the asset owner for restoring the Automation Solution or its components to normal operation.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that the asset owner knows how to use the restore capabilities provided by the service provider for the Automation Solution.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for preparing or providing documentation that describes how to restore the Automation Solution or its components (i.e. a partial restore) from backup data. The documentation should include instructions for handling abnormal scenarios, such as how to restore an Automation Solution whose architecture may have changed since the backup was made. In these cases, the restore may not be complete and the asset owner should be made aware of conditions such as these. This requirement applies to both operational Automation Solutions and simulations."

Backup data can be a target for compromise, for example, to prevent proper restoration or to gain access to confidential data."

    "Requirement": "The service provider shall have the capability to verify that:\n1) it is possible to perform a complete back-up of the Automation Solution, and\n2) it is possible to restore a fully functioning Automation Solution from this back-up.",
    "Rationale": "The capability specified by this BR ensures that the backup and restore capabilities for the Automation Solution work as intended.\nHaving this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for demonstrating or otherwise verifying that a backup can be performed successfully and that the Automation Solution can be restored from this backup. This process should be flexible to allow the asset owner to request only a partial backup/restore to gain confidence that the backup capability can be used successfully.\nIf the backup includes the backup of data bases, then having this capability also means that the service provider has an identifiable process for demonstrating or otherwise verifying that automatic rollback is stopped/disabled prior to starting the backup. Automatic rollback can cause inconsistencies in the data base should it occur while the data base is being backed up."

The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the service provider is prepared to integrate its backup/restore activities with the asset owner's backup requirements."
