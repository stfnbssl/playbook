The capabilities specified by this BR and its RE are used to ensure that an accurate representation of the Automation Solution network architecture is documented and available for security-related activities, such as risk assessments and forensic analysis.
Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for keeping its network architecture documentation current.

The capability specified by this BR is used to ensure that all remote access connections to the Automation Solution are authorized by the asset owner. Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for using only those connections that have been approved by the asset owner. These remote access connections may be user- to-system or system-to-system, may traverse the Internet and/or include the use of modems, and/or may be provided and maintained by the asset owner. Requirements for management of these connections and the time needed by the asset owner to approve the connections are beyond the scope of this requirement. In addition, the asset owner may request the service provider to provide or maintain the connections and may provide the appropriate requirements at that time. For example, the asset owner may not allow TCP/IP protocols to be used over external connections that use modems.

The capability specified by this RE is defined to ensure that all connections used to support remote access to the Automation Solution by the service provider are protected. Service providers often offer remote support and troubleshooting/diagnostic services to the Automation Solution.
Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for using encrypted links, such as VPNs, for remote access to the Automation Solution over the Internet by the service provider (e.g. from its facilities or other remote locations).

NOTE 1 Logging of security-related events is addressed by SP.08.02 BR. 
NOTE 2 Logging and reporting of alarms and events is addressed by SP.08.03 BR.
|
The capabilities specified by this BR and its REs are used to ensure that security incidents relevant to the Automation Solution are managed from detection through disposition to allow the security risk position of the Automation Solution to be maintained.
Having this capability means that the service provider has an identifiable process for detecting, handling and reporting cyber-security incidents for Automation Solution components for which the service provider is responsible.
What constitutes an incident, which incidents are significant, and under what conditions they are reported to the asset owner are all part of the service provider's incident handling procedures. Incident handling implementation may be controlled by specific agreements between the asset owner and service provider, such as non-disclosure agreements and/or other contractual vehicles between the asset owner and service provider. These contractual vehicles often identify proprietary data to be protected and the types of compromise that to be reported.
Typically, the process of identifying incidents includes (1) event analysis and correlation, and (2) examination and triage of resulting compromises and potential incidents to yield incidents. SP.03.03 BR addresses handling of vulnerabilities that may have been exposed by this process or by other processes. In many cases, recognition that a compromise has occurred and that an associated loss has resulted can be difficult and may involve subjectivity and judgment. The specification of this process and the precise definition of what constitutes an incident is beyond the scope of these requirements.

3) decentralized access to this data base for the management of accounts,
4) decentralized enforcement of the account settings (e.g. passwords, operating system privileges, and access control lists) defined in this data base.

The capability specified by this BR is used to simplify the management of user accounts for Automation Solutions composed of multiple workstations and servers. Without such capabilities, separately managing accounts across individual workstations and servers often results in inconsistencies that result in denial of service to resources and/or the inappropriate granting of access to

2) allows accounts, including user, administrator/super
user accounts, and service accounts (i.e. accounts that do not provide for interactive login), to be defined and managed only by authorized users, 3) allows administrators to manage accounts from a specified set of workstations/servers in the Automation Solution, not just from a single dedicated workstation,
4) distributes the enforcement of account access control lists and privileges to the location where the access or privilege is to be executed.

Operator accounts are typically individual user accounts configured with operator privileges that provide visibility into the physical environment (e.g. the process) being controlled.
This requirement does not prevent permanent accounts from being removed, or otherwise disabled, based on explicit actions taken by an administrator.
A commonly recommended measure for Unix-based systems is to configure the root account to use the false or "nologin" shell (and thus effectively denying all logins using this account) and creating a differently named alias for the root account for use by authorized administrative users.

Passwords that remain unchanged increase the risk that they will be disclosed/discovered and used to gain unauthorized access to the system. In addition, changing passwords periodically limits the length of time an attacker has to discover a password.
