                           <p class="oj-normal">Recently, more advanced machinery, which is less dependent on human operators, has been introduced on the market. Such machinery is working on defined tasks and in structured environments, yet it can learn to perform new actions in this context and become more autonomous. Further refinements to machinery, already in place or to be expected, include real-time processing of information, problem solving, mobility, sensor systems, learning, adaptability, and capability of operating in unstructured environments (for example construction sites). The Commission Report on the safety and liability implications of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Robotics of 19 February 2020, states that the emergence of new digital technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and robotics, raises new challenges in terms of product safety. The report concludes that the current product safety legislation, including Directive 2006/42/EC, contains a number of gaps in this respect that need to be addressed. Thus, this Regulation should cover the safety risks stemming from new digital technologies.</p>

Machinery or related products should comply with the essential health and safety requirements when placed on the market or put into service. Where such products are subsequently modified, by physical or digital means, in a way that is not foreseen or planned by the manufacturer and which affects the safety of such products by creating a new hazard or increasing an existing risk, the modification should be considered as substantial when new significant protective measures are required. However, repair and maintenance operations which do not affect the machinery or related product’s compliance with the relevant essential health and safety requirements should not be considered to be substantial modifications. In order to ensure the compliance of such a product with the relevant essential health and safety requirements, the person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. In order to avoid an unnecessary and disproportionate burden, the person carrying out the substantial modification should not be required to repeat tests and produce new documentation in relation to machinery or related products that are part of an assembly of machinery, and that are not affected by the modification.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The list of products in Annex IV of Directive 2006/42/EC has until now been based on the risk emanating from the intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse of those products or their critical protective function. Nevertheless, the machinery field embraces new ways of designing and constructing machinery or related products that might present higher risk factors, regardless of such intended use or any reasonably foreseeable misuse. For example, systems with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be included in Annex I due to their characteristics such as data dependency, opacity, autonomy and connectivity, which might considerably increase the probability and severity of harm and seriously affect the safety of the machinery or related product. Therefore, the conformity assessment of a safety component or a system with self-evolving behaviour ensuring safety functions should be carried out by a third party, whether or not the safety component has been placed independently on the market or is part of a system embedded in machinery that is placed on the market. However, where machinery embeds a system of which the safety component has already been subject to third party conformity assessment when it was placed independently on the market, that machinery should not have to be re-certified by a third party solely on the basis of the embedding of that system.</p>

When machinery or a related product is being designed, the requirements of the first chapter and the requirements of one or more of the other chapters shall be taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1 of these General Principles. Essential health and safety requirements for the protection of the environment are applicable only to the machinery or related products referred to in section 2.4.</span>

            <p class="oj-normal">The outside parts of the guard shall be so designed, constructed and arranged that they cannot turn with the removable mechanical transmission device. The guard shall cover the transmission to the ends of the inner jaws in the case of simple universal joints and at least to the centre of the outer joint or joints in the case of wide-angle universal joints.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">If means of access to working positions are provided near to the removable mechanical transmission device, they shall be designed and constructed in such a way that the shaft guards cannot be used as steps, unless designed and constructed for that purpose.</p>
