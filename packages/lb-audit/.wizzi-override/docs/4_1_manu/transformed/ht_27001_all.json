But there is cost in time, resources, money, technology that may just not be appropriate. And that is ok. Document what you are doing, cover it in risk management, have a record of your decision, and what ever level of implementation you do show that you accepted the risk. The argument will come that you have included the control in your SOA and that it applies to you and therefore all of it applies to you.
