    1 Scope
    This part of IEC 62443 specifies process requirements for the secure development of products used in industrial automation and control systems. it defines a secure development life-cycle (SDL) for the purpose of developing and maintain ing secure products. this life-cycle includes security requirements definition, secure design, secure implementation (including coding guidelines), verification and validation, defect management, patch management and product end -of- life. These requirements can be applied to new or existing processes for developing, maintain ing and reti ring hardware, software or firmware for new or existing products. These requirements apply to the developer and maintainer of the product, but not to the integrator or user of the product. A summary list of the requirements in this document can be found in Annex B.

    a ttackers are faced with breaking through or bypassing each layer without being detected;
    •
    a fl aw in one layer can be mitigated by capabilities in other layers;
    •
    system security becomes a set of layers within the overall network security; and
    •
    each layer shou ld be au tonomous and not re l y on the same functional ity nor have the same failure modes as the other layers.
    3.1.1 6 dependent component

    3.3 Conventions
    Requirements defined in this document generally beg in with the phrase “A process shall be employed… ”. this term inology is used to specify that the required processes have to be part of the product suppliers documented product development life-cycle processes. The practice of these requirements is dependent on the product supplier having product development projects that require the use of these processes.
    According to 5.5, products requiring the use of these processes shall be identified.
    4 General principles
    4.1 Concepts
    The primary goal of these requirements is to provide a framework to address a secure by design, defense in depth approach to design ing, build ing, maintain ing and reti ring products used in industrial automation and control products and systems. application of the framework is intended to provide confidence that the component, product or system has security commensurate with its expected level of risk throughou t the product’s life-cycle. whi le the concept of security levels is not discussed in this document, complying with this document
    – 1 8 – IEC 62443-4-1: 201 8 © I EC 201 8
    will he lp ensure that the security capabilities implemented in the product (see IEC 62443-4-2 3 [1 1 ]) will be implemented correctl y and that any known security vulnerabilities in the product are e l im inated or mitigated. Therefore, compliance with this document supports meeting the overall capability security level (SL-C) of the product.
    The secondary goal of these requirements is to align the development process with the e levated security needs of product users of I ndustrial Automation and Control Systems (for example, providers of IEC 62443-2-4 capabilities such as integrators and maintenance con tractors). this means that the process needs to generate items such as well -documented security configurations and patch management policies and procedures, as well as providing clear and succinct commun ications about security vulnerabilities uncovered in the product.
    NOTE 1 For I ACS, IEC 62443-3-2 4 [9] descri bes requirements for determining the expected level of risk associated with the system ’s zones and condu its.
    Figure 3 illustrates how secure by design principles in this document con tribu te to a defense in depth strategy for the product. The security management practice is shown on the ou termost ci rcle because it is applied throughout all the other practices to ensure that the practices are being followed and managed. The other practices, shown on the second ci rcle are applied throughou t the development life-cycle, often in an iterative pattern. These practices each con tribute to the overall defense in depth strategy which is shown as the cen ter of the ci rcle because it represents the key result of following the security development life-cycle. The defect management and security update management provide verifi ed repai rs to the secure implementation, and fall under the category of overall security management in the d iagram.
    Figure 3 – Defence in depth strategy is a key ph i losophy of the secure product life-cycle
    A key concept used th roughou t this document is the use of threat modelling. design and implementation reviews to refine work products improve the security posture of a product. Reviews of any work product (for example, requirements, design records, implemented

    modu les and verification/validation testing) through any means (for example, manual, automated or a combination) are used to discover security-related issues in the product. An impact analysis of each discovered issue assesses its security severity based on its potential comprom ise (for example, availability, integrity and confidential ity) and its associated losses (for example, control of the process, view of the process and in te l lectual property). Then, the resolution process determines the most appropriate course of action based on the issue’s severity and the su itability of various response options.
    4.2 Maturi ty model
    There is a range of methods by which a product supplier could comply with the requirements specified in this document. The maturi ty model sets benchmarks for meeting these requirements.
    These benchmarks are defined by maturi ty levels as shown in Table 1. The maturi ty levels are based on the Capability Maturi ty Model integration (CMMI) for Development (CMMI -DEV) model [42]. Table 1 shows the relationsh ip to the CMMI -DEV in the description column.
    Maturi ty levels provide more details on how thorough l y a supplier has met these requirements. Therefore, these levels can be used by system integrators and asset owners to assess the level of ri gor used to develop products.
    The purpose of the maturi ty levels described in this subclause is to provide an organization a benchmark to defi ne their read iness to use their processes and procedures to design and implement a secure product. Us ing these benchmarks, it is possible that an organization will discover that it is not ready to implement all requirements to the same level of maturi ty.
    When design ing, and implementing a secure product according to this document (see IEC 62443-4-2 and IEC 62443-3-3), all applicable requirements as defined by SM-5 in this document shall be followed and used in the development lifecycle of that product regard less of the maturi ty level of the organization. SM-5 provides for case-by-case exceptions for applicability of requirements.
    NOTE 1 I ndustry g roups/sectors identify/sel ect those maturi ty levels that best meet their in d ivi dual needs.
    NOTE 2 it is intended that over time and for a specific requirement, a product supplier’ s development capabilities will evolve to h i gher levels as it gai ns profi ciency in meeting the requirement. The rate of evol u ti on will often vary for each requirement. For example, a product supplier m ight reach Level 4 for Practi ce 6 months or years before they reach Leve l 4 for Practi ce 5.
    NOTE 3 These maturi ty levels have been defi ned as a way for organ i zations to measure and report their compliance to this document. this model will allow organ i zations to evol ve to h i gher (more mature) levels of capabilities for their processes.
    NOTE 4 Measu rement driven conti nuous improvement is vital for improving the maturi ty level of a product supplier for each practice in this document. in addition, s i nce best practices for secure product deve lopment are evolving, product suppliers need to seek ou t and implement new best practices.

    Table 1 – Maturi ty levels
    Level CMMI -DEV IEC 62443-4-1 IEC 62443-4-1 Description
    1 in iti a l in iti a l Product suppliers typically perform product devel opment in an ad -hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented) manner. As a result, consistency across projects and repeatability of processes may not be poss ible.
    2 Managed Managed At this level, the product supplier has the capability to manage the development of a product according to wri tten pol i cies (including objecti ves). The product supplier also has evidence to show that personnel who will perform the process have the expertise, are trained and /or follow wri tten procedu res to perform it.
    However, at this level, the organization does not have experience developing products to all of the wri tten pol i cies. this wou l d be the case when the organ i zation has updated its procedures to conform to this document, but has not yet pu t all of the procedu res in to actual practice, yet.
    The development d i scip line refl ected by maturi ty level 2 helps to ensure that devel opment practices are repeatable, even d uring times of stress. When these practices are in place, their execution will be performed and managed according to their documented p l ans.
    NOTE At this level, the CMMI and IEC 62443-4-1 maturi ty models are fundamentally the same, with the excepti on that IEC 62443-4-1 recogn i zes that there may be a significant d elay between defi n ing /formal i zing a process and executing (practi cing) it. Therefore, the execution related aspects of the CMMI -DEV Level 2 are deferred to Level 3.
    3 Defi ned Defi ned (Practi ced)
    The performance of a level 3 product supplier can be shown to be repeatable across the supplier’ s organ i zation. The processes have been practiced, and evidence exi sts to demonstrate that this has occurred.
    NOTE At this level, the CMMI and IEC 62443-4-1 maturi ty models are fundamentally the same, with the excepti on that the execution re l ated aspects of the CMMI -DEV level 2 are included here. Therefore, a process at level 3 is a level 2 process that the supplier has practiced for at least one product.
    4 Quanti tatively Managed
    Improving At this level, Part 4-1 combines CMMI -DEV levels 4 and 5. U s ing su itable process metri cs, product suppliers control the effecti veness and performance of the product and demonstrate conti nuous improvement in these areas.5 Optim izing

                        +b vulnerabilities resulting from it (for example, where it can be open to attack). For an internal component of the design, 
                        +b the concept of the product security context is extended to include the security context provided by surround ing product components. For example,

                        +b the network(s) to which the workstation connects and the software environment of the workstation in which the application runs.
                        +b Identifying threats, users, assets and trust boundaries associated withinterfaces specifies who is expected to use the interfaces,
