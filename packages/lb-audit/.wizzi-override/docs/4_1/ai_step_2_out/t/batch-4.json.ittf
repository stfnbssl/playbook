        explanation "The SL-C defines the security capabilities a product must possess to meet
            +b specific industrial cybersecurity needs. It ensures alignment with IEC
            +b 62443-4-1 by quantifying security requirements."
        context "SL-C is critical for ICS products to mitigate risks in operational
            +b environments. It guides developers in implementing appropriate security
            +b controls."
        [ challenges
            "Defining accurate SL-C for heterogeneous ICS environments (e.g., a power plant with mixed legacy/modern systems)."
            "Mapping SL-C to technical controls when vendor documentation lacks security specifics."
            "Maintaining SL-C consistency across product updates in long-lifecycle ICS equipment."
            "Addressing SL-C conflicts between safety and security requirements in SIL-rated systems."
            "Validating SL-C achievement in third-party components (e.g., PLC firmware with unknown provenance)."
