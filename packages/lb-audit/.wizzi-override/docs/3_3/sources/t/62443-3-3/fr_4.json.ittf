                description "The control system shall provide the capability to protect the confidentiality of information 
                    +b for which explicit read authorization is supported, whether at rest or in transit."
                rationale "Protection of information, at rest or in transit, can be maintained through physical means, 
                    +b compartmentalization or encryption, among other techniques. 
                    +b It is crucial that the technique chosen considers the potential ramifications on 
                    +b control system performance and the capability to recover from system failure or attack.
                    +b The decision whether the confidentiality of a given piece of information should be protected or not 
                    +b depends on the context and cannot be made at product design. 
                    +b However, the fact that an organization limits access to information by configuring 
                    +b explicit read authorizations in the control system is an indicator that this information 
                    +b is considered confidential by the organization. 
                    +b Thus, all information for which the control system supports the capability to 
                    +b assign explicit read authorizations should be considered potentially confidential and 
                    +b thus the control system should also provide the capability to protect it.
                    +b Different organizations and industries may require different levels of encryption strength 
                    +b for different categories of information, based on the sensitivity of the information as well as 
                    +b industry standards and regulatory requirements (see 8.5, SR 4.3 – Use of cryptography). 
                    +b In some situations network configuration information stored and processed in switches and routers 
                    +b may be considered as confidential.
                    +b Communications involving exposed information transfer may be vulnerable to eavesdropping or tampering. 
                    +b If the control system is depending upon an external communications service provider, 
                    +b it may be more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of 
                    +b needed security requirements for communication confidentiality. 
                    +b In such cases, it may be appropriate to implement compensating countermeasures or 
                    +b explicitly accept the additional risk.
                    +b Entities should also be cognizant of information confidentiality when portable and mobile devices 
                    +b are utilized (for example, engineering laptops and USB sticks).
                    +b As required by 5.7, SR 1.5 – Authenticator management, authentication information, 
                    +b such as passwords, should be considered confidential, and thus never be sent in the clear."
