Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about current and emerging threats, threat actors, and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It’s about knowing your enemy—gathering actionable data to understand what’s out there, who’s targeting you, and how they might strike. It’s less about immediate action and more about building a knowledge base to inform decisions.
Key Activities:
Collection: Pull data from diverse sources—open web, dark web, X posts, security reports, or vendor feeds.

Analysis: Turn raw data into insights (e.g., “This ransomware group targets healthcare with spear-phishing”).

Distribution: Share findings with teams to guide strategy or defenses.

Types: Strategic (high-level trends for execs), operational (specific campaigns), tactical (technical indicators like IP addresses).

Example: A cybersecurity team learns from Threat Intelligence that a new exploit kit is circulating on the dark web, targeting unpatched VPNs. They use this to prioritize patching efforts.

Threat Intelligence vs. Threat Management
Threat Intelligence is the input—the reconnaissance that tells you what’s coming—while Threat Management is the output—the active response to neutralize or mitigate a threat. Intelligence might warn you about a phishing campaign, but Management is what blocks the emails and isolates affected systems. Think of it like weather forecasting (Intelligence) versus storm response (Management).
Focus: Intelligence is predictive and informative; Management is reactive and operational.

Timing: Intelligence operates before (and during) a threat, while Management kicks in when the threat is active or imminent.

Example: Intelligence identifies a zero-day exploit; Management deploys a workaround until a patch is available.

Is Threat Intelligence More Akin to Risk Management?
Yes, Threat Intelligence aligns more closely with Risk Management than Threat Management, but it’s not a perfect match—it’s more of a supporting player. Here’s why:
Shared Ground with Risk Management:
Proactive Nature: Both focus on preparation rather than reaction. Risk Management assesses potential vulnerabilities and impacts; Threat Intelligence provides the data to make those assessments accurate (e.g., “This threat raises the likelihood of a breach”).

Strategic Scope: Intelligence informs the “Identify” step in Risk Management (e.g., NIST CSF’s ID.RA-3: “Threats are identified and documented”). It helps prioritize risks by spotlighting real-world threats.

Decision-Making: Risk Management uses Intelligence to decide where to allocate resources—like investing in firewalls if APTs are trending in your sector.

Differences from Risk Management:
Granularity: Risk Management is broader, covering all risks (not just threats—like natural disasters or human error), while Threat Intelligence zeroes in on cyber threats specifically.

Output: Risk Management produces a risk mitigation plan; Threat Intelligence delivers data or insights, not the plan itself.

Execution: Risk Management includes mitigation steps (e.g., deploying controls), while Intelligence stops at informing those steps.

The Triad: Risk Management, Threat Intelligence, and Threat Management
Think of them as a team:
Risk Management sets the strategy: “What are our biggest risks, and how do we reduce them?”

Threat Intelligence feeds the strategy: “Here’s what attackers are doing—focus on these threats.”

Threat Management executes tactically: “We’ve got an attack—let’s stop it now.”

For example, in NIST CSF, Threat Intelligence supports the “Identify” function (e.g., understanding the threat landscape), Risk Management spans “Identify” and “Protect” (e.g., assessing and mitigating risks), and Threat Management drives “Detect” and “Respond” (e.g., handling incidents).
Bottom Line
Threat Intelligence is closer to Risk Management because it’s proactive and informs decision-making, but it’s a specialized subset—focused on threat data—rather than the full risk picture. It’s like the scout that tells Risk Management where the enemy is camped, while Threat Management is the squad sent to fight them off.
