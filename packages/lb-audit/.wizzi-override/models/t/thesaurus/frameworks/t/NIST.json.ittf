6. Relationship Between SSDF and CSF
The SSDF can be seen as a specialized companion to the CSF. 
While the CSF provides a broad framework for managing cybersecurity risks, 
the SSDF zooms in on the specific domain of software development.

    Alignment: SSDF practices can be mapped to CSF functions. For example:
    SSDF’s “Protect the Software” aligns with CSF’s “Protect” function.

    SSDF’s “Respond to Vulnerabilities” aligns with CSF’s “Respond” and “Recover” functions.

    Organizations using the CSF can incorporate the SSDF to strengthen the software development aspects of their cybersecurity strategy.


        [ useCases
            "A hospital uses the CSF to assess its overall cybersecurity posture, including protecting patient data, securing medical devices, and responding to ransomware attacks."
            "A manufacturing company adopts the CSF to manage risks across its IT and operational technology (OT) environments."

Conclusion
In essence, the SSDF is a specialized framework for embedding security into software development, while the CSF is a broader, strategic tool for managing cybersecurity risks across an organization. They complement each other: the SSDF provides detailed guidance for a specific subset of security (software), while the CSF offers a holistic approach that can encompass the SSDF as part of a larger cybersecurity program. Organizations involved in software development might use both—leveraging the SSDF for their SDLC and the CSF for enterprise-wide risk management.
