        purpose "The processes specified by this practice are used to provide user documentation that describes how to integrate, configure, and maintain 
            +b the defense in depth strategy of the product in accordance with its product security context (see Clause 6). IEC 62443-2-4 defines 
            +b complementary hardening requirements for the use of this documentation by IACS service providers.
            +b Applying and maintaining the defense in depth strategy for a specific installation will typically address the following:
            +b a) policies and procedures associated with the product security context, as defined in Clause 6;
            +b b) architectural considerations, such as firewall placement and use of compensating mechanisms including security measures, as defined in Clause 7;
            +b c) configuring security settings/options, such as configuring firewall rules, delegation, certificate management, and managing user accounts (for example, setting their privileges/permissions); and
            +b d) use of tools to assist in thehardening."
