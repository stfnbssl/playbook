But there is cost in time, resources, money, technology that may just not be appropriate. And that is ok. Document what you are doing, cover it in risk management, have a record of your decision, and what ever level of implementation you do show that you accepted the risk. The argument will come that you have included the control in your SOA and that it applies to you and therefore all of it applies to you. This is partly correct in that you have considered that the control applies to you because labelling information that is confidential and marking information and being able to control information based on labelling makes sense but you did not necessarily sign up carte blanche to an enterprise level metadata solution.

It also helps to create a fair and consistent workplace, and it can help to protect the organisation from legal liability.Here are some of the benefits of having a disciplinary process in place:Increased employee compliance with policies and procedures. A well-defined disciplinary process can help to ensure that employees are aware of the organisations expectations and that they are held accountable for their actions. This can help to prevent misconduct and to create a more productive and safe workplace.Decreased employee turnover. Employees who feel that they are being treated fairly and consistently are less likely to leave their jobs. This can save the organisation money in recruiting and training costs.Increased employee morale. A fair and consistent disciplinary process can help to create a positive work environment where employees feel valued and respected. This can lead to increased morale and productivity.Decreased legal liability. By having a clear and well-defined disciplinary process in place, organisations can help to protect themselves from legal liability in the event of employee misconduct. This is because the organisation can demonstrate that it has taken steps to prevent and address misconduct."

By implementing ISO 27001 6.5 Responsibilities after termination or change of employment, organisations can demonstrate compliance with these regulations.Enhanced customer confidence. Customers are increasingly concerned about the security of their personal data. By demonstrating that your organisation is committed to information security, you can build customer confidence and loyalty.Reduced costs. The cost of a data breach can be significant, including the cost of notifying affected individuals, fines, and legal fees. By implementing ISO 27001 6.5 Responsibilities after termination or change of employment, organisations can reduce the risk of a data breach and the associated costs.Reputation Protection: In the event of a breach having a responsibilities after termination procedure in place will reduce the potential for fines and reduce the PR impact of an event"

By taking the necessary steps, organisations can help to protect confidential information, comply with regulations, protect their reputation, and protect employees.Here are some of the reasons why responsibilities after termination or change of employment are important:To protect confidential information. When an employee leaves an organisation, they may still have access to confidential information. This information could be used for malicious purposes, such as selling it to competitors or using it to commit identity theft. By revoking the employee’s access to confidential information and collecting any company-owned assets, organisations can help to protect this information.To comply with regulations. Many regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require organisations to protect the confidentiality of personal data. By implementing appropriate controls after termination or change of employment, organisations can demonstrate compliance with these regulations.To protect the organisation’s reputation. A data breach can damage an organisation’s reputation. By taking steps to protect confidential information after termination or change of employment, organisations can help to reduce the risk of a data breach and the associated damage to their reputation.To protect employees. Employees who are terminated or have their employment changed may be angry or upset. By taking steps to manage these emotions, organisations can help to protect employees from making rash decisions that could harm themselves or others."

As a result, the sooner that you catch it, the less damage that it will do. Our worst case scenario is that an event goes undetected.In fact, there are certain regulations, such as the GDPR that requires to report certain events within a certain time frame and as a result, to be compliant, we need effective reporting. In this situation, take for example a data breach of personal information which would potentially have to be reported to the regulator within 72 hours.Additionally, information security event reporting can help you to identify and assess information security risks as part of your continual improvement process. Consequently, by collecting and recording the types of events and the impact and performing root cause analysis you are able to see if there is an underlying risk that needs addressing. At this point, if there is, it can be addressed by effective risk treatment."
