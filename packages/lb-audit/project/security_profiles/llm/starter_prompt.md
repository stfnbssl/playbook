You are a cybersecurity + data design expert. 
I’ve already built a **canonical controls catalog** and would like to extend it to **security profiles per IEC 62443-1-5** (profiles for IACS). 

Please set up a database-backed approach to author, version, and apply profiles. 

**Context (what I already have for controls):** * A normalized **canonical controls** catalog with fields like: * canonical_id, objective, statement, type, risk_theme, criticality, * applicability (role/env/lifecycle/min\_security\_level/conditions), * params (name/description/default), * mappings (framework\_code, section\_path, relation → e.g., 62443-3-3 SR x.y, 62443-4-2 CR x.y, ISO/IEC 27002), * checklist items (question, answer\_type, evidence\_type), * a separate table of evidence_types. * LLM-assisted pipeline for **E1–E3** (threat elicitation, rationale linkage, checklist specialization) with JSON-Schema validation and guardrails. * A small starter set of example profiles (used only as baseline), plus a script that derives a machine-specific checklist from the catalog. **Goal now (IEC 62443-1-5 security profiles):** Design a **profiles database** and workflow that: 
1. Encodes **profile scope** (role: AssetOwner/SystemIntegrator/Manufacturer; environment: OT/IT/Edge; lifecycle; jurisdiction; essential\_service; SL-T targets). 
2. Selects **controls** from the canonical catalog, with **parameters**, **weights**, and **conditions** (e.g., GDPR overlays), and supports **inheritance/overlays** (profile → child profile). 
3. Implements **62443-1-5 profile logic** for zones/conduits and security levels, including rules to materialize **profile→controls→checklist→evidence**. 
4. Supports **versioning** (semver, status, release notes), **diff**, and **deprecation**. 
5. Exposes **views/queries** to compute profile coverage vs SR/CR mappings and to export audit-ready checklists. 

**Please deliver:** 
* A concise **plan** (2–3 paragraphs) of the data model and authoring workflow aligned to IEC 62443-1-5. 
* **Portable SQL DDL** (PostgreSQL-first but SQLite-compatible where possible) for: * profile, profile_rule/scope, profile_control (with param_values, required, weight), profile_inheritance, profile_version, and helper tables/views (v_profile_checklist, v_profile_mappings). 
* A **JSON Schema** for a profile definition (to validate authored profiles). 
* **INSERT scaffolding** for at least two concrete profiles: * “OT Asset Owner — SL2 Operations (62443)” * “OT Asset Owner — SL3 Operations (62443)” (Optionally: “Manufacturer — CRA/62443 SDLC”.) 
* SQL **views or stored logic** to: * expand profile → controls → checklist (dedup) → evidence summary, * compute coverage vs 62443-3-3 SR and 62443-4-2 CR (using the existing mappings). 
* **LLM prompt patterns** (audit-safe) for profile authoring: * P1: “Profile scoping assistant” (collects scope/targets/overlays with fixed enums). * P2: “Rule compiler” (turns scope into a deterministic selection of controls; no hallucinated IDs). * P3: “Checklist specialization” (adds ≤2 targeted questions/evidence per control based on context). Include JSON-only outputs and guardrails (closed lists, max lengths, refusal to invent control IDs). * 
**Governance & versioning** notes: how to manage drafts → review → release, inheritance/overlays, and how to prove traceability profile→control→mapping→evidence. Constraints: * Do not invent frameworks; rely on existing mappings to IEC 62443-3-3 SR and 62443-4-2 CR. * Keep SQL portable (avoid DB-specific extensions unless you provide a fallback). * Provide examples that are directly runnable (DDL + minimal INSERTs).
