### Overview
The EU NIS2 Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) aims to achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, focusing on essential and important entities in critical sectors. Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) manufacturers and system integrators are particularly affected if they qualify as important entities under Annex II (e.g., manufacturing of computer, electronic, optical products; electrical equipment; or machinery), or if they supply ICT products/services to essential/important entities. This triggers obligations for cybersecurity risk management, supply chain security, incident reporting, and supervision. Unlike the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS2 is more entity-focused rather than product-focused, but it indirectly impacts suppliers through supply chain requirements.

Exemptions or reduced obligations may apply for micro/small enterprises (per Recommendation 2003/361/EC), unless they are critical (Article 2). No direct mentions of "IACS," but relevance stems from industrial applications in critical sectors like energy, manufacturing, and transport.

Below is a table summarizing the most relevant chapters, sections, and articles, based on their focus on entity obligations, risk management, supply chain, reporting, and enforcement. Relevance is high for core obligations, medium for frameworks/supervision, and low for procedural aspects.

| Chapter/Section | Relevant Articles | Relevance Level | Why Relevant |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Chapter I: General Provisions** | 1 (Subject matter), 2 (Scope), 3 (Essential and important entities), 4 (Sector-specific Union legal acts), 6 (Definitions) | High | Defines scope, including IACS manufacturers/integrators as important entities if in Annex II sectors (e.g., manufacturing subsectors like electrical equipment or machinery); excludes micro/small enterprises unless critical; mandates application to suppliers via supply chain risks. |
| **Chapter II: Coordinated Cybersecurity Frameworks** (Section 1: National cybersecurity frameworks) | 7 (National cybersecurity strategy) | Medium | Requires Member States to adopt policies on ICT supply chain security (Article 7(2)(a)) and vulnerability disclosure; IACS manufacturers must align with national strategies for secure product development and procurement in critical sectors. |
| **Chapter IV: Cybersecurity Risk-Management Measures and Reporting Obligations** (Section 1: Cybersecurity risk-management measures and reporting obligations) | 20 (Governance), 21 (Cybersecurity risk-management measures), 23 (Reporting obligations), 24 (Use of European cybersecurity certification schemes), 25 (Standardisation) | High | Mandates risk assessments, supply chain security (Article 21(2)(d)), vulnerability handling, and incident reporting (e.g., early warning within 24 hours); applies to IACS as network/information systems in critical sectors; encourages certification for compliance. |
| **Chapter IV: Cybersecurity Risk-Management Measures and Reporting Obligations** (Section 2: Coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains) | 22 (Coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains) | High | Enables EU-level assessments of critical ICT supply chains (e.g., for IACS components); involves stakeholders like manufacturers to identify risks and measures, impacting IACS suppliers to essential services. |
| **Chapter V: Jurisdiction and Registration** | 26 (Jurisdiction and territoriality), 27 (Registry of entities) | Medium | Requires registration of essential/important entities (including potential IACS manufacturers); ensures jurisdiction over non-EU suppliers if services are provided in the Union. |
| **Chapter VI: Information Sharing** | 29 (Cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements), 30 (Voluntary notification of relevant information) | Medium | Allows voluntary sharing of threats/vulnerabilities among suppliers and entities; useful for IACS integrators to collaborate on supply chain security without compromising confidentiality. |
| **Chapter VII: Supervision and Enforcement** (Section 1: General aspects concerning supervision and enforcement) | 31 (General aspects concerning supervision and enforcement), 32 (Supervisory and enforcement measures in relation to essential entities), 33 (Supervisory and enforcement measures in relation to important entities), 34 (General conditions for imposing administrative fines on essential and important entities), 35 (Infringements entailing a personal data breach), 36 (Penalties) | High | Establishes audits, inspections, and fines (up to 2% of turnover for essential entities); applies to IACS manufacturers if non-compliant with risk management/reporting, emphasizing accountability for critical infrastructure suppliers. |

### Key Annexes Relevant to IACS
- **Annex I: Sectors of high criticality** (Essential entities): Includes energy, transport, health, etc.; IACS used here trigger stricter obligations for suppliers.
- **Annex II: Other critical sectors** (Important entities): Includes manufacturing subsectors (e.g., computer/electronic/optical products, electrical equipment, machinery); directly classifies many IACS manufacturers as important entities, requiring compliance with Articles 21 and 23.

For IACS-specific applicability, check Annex II classifications to confirm entity status, as this determines supervision level (ex-ante for essential, ex-post for important). Manufacturers should prioritize Chapter IV for operational duties like supply chain assessments. Transposition deadline is October 17, 2024, with application from October 18, 2024.
