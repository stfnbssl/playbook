### Overview
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 regulates the processing of personal data. For Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) manufacturers and system integrators, relevance arises when IACS process personal data, such as employee access logs, biometric authentication, surveillance in industrial environments, or sensor data identifying individuals. In such cases, manufacturers/integrators may act as data controllers (determining purposes/means of processing) or processors (processing on behalf of controllers), triggering obligations for privacy by design, security, risk assessments, and compliance documentation. GDPR does not directly target industrial systems but applies horizontally if personal data is involved. Exemptions or derogations may apply under Article 2(3) for certain Union laws, but IACS in non-exempt contexts must comply.

Below is a table summarizing the most relevant chapters, sections, and articles, based on their focus on principles, obligations, security, impact assessments, and transfers. Relevance is high for core operational duties, medium for supportive mechanisms, and low for less direct aspects (none listed as low here).

| Chapter/Section | Relevant Articles | Relevance Level | Why Relevant |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Chapter II: Principles** | 5 (Principles relating to processing of personal data), 6 (Lawfulness of processing) | High | Establishes key principles like data minimization, purpose limitation, integrity, and confidentiality; ensures lawful bases for processing—critical for IACS to handle personal data securely and legitimately in industrial contexts. |
| **Chapter IV, Section 1: General Obligations** | 24 (Responsibility of the controller), 25 (Data protection by design and by default), 28 (Processor), 30 (Records of processing activities) | High | Mandates controllers to implement compliance measures; requires embedding privacy features in IACS design (e.g., default secure configurations); outlines processor contracts and security; demands documentation of activities—essential for manufacturers/integrators to prove accountability in data-handling systems. |
| **Chapter IV, Section 2: Security of Personal Data** | 32 (Security of processing), 33 (Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority), 34 (Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject) | High | Requires technical measures like encryption and pseudonymization to protect data; mandates breach reporting within 72 hours and notifications to affected individuals if high-risk—vital for securing IACS against cyber threats and managing incidents in connected industrial environments. |
| **Chapter IV, Section 3: Data Protection Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation** | 35 (Data protection impact assessment), 36 (Prior consultation) | High | Obliges DPIAs for high-risk processing (e.g., large-scale IACS with profiling or sensitive data); requires consulting authorities if risks remain—key for manufacturers/integrators deploying innovative or automated systems to assess and mitigate privacy impacts. |
| **Chapter IV, Section 4: Data Protection Officer** | 37 (Designation of the data protection officer), 39 (Tasks of the data protection officer) | Medium | Mandates appointing a DPO for large-scale or sensitive processing; outlines advisory and monitoring tasks—relevant if IACS involve such activities, helping manufacturers/integrators maintain compliance oversight. |
| **Chapter IV, Section 5: Codes of Conduct and Certification** | 40 (Codes of conduct), 42 (Certification) | Medium | Encourages industry codes and certifications to demonstrate compliance; useful for IACS sector to adopt standards proving adherence to GDPR in technical systems. |
| **Chapter V: Transfers of Personal Data to Third Countries or International Organisations** | 44 (General principle for transfers), 45-49 (Various transfer mechanisms, e.g., adequacy decisions, safeguards), 46 (Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards) | Medium | Governs international data flows; requires safeguards like standard contractual clauses—pertinent for global IACS manufacturers/integrators ensuring personal data protection in cross-border operations or supply chains. |

For IACS-specific applicability, prioritize Chapter IV for practical obligations, especially Articles 25, 32, and 35, as they address design, security, and risk in technical systems. If no personal data is processed, GDPR may not apply (per Article 2), but assessments are recommended. Consult Recitals 78 (privacy by design) and 83 (security risks) for interpretive guidance.
