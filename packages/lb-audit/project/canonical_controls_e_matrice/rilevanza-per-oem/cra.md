### Overview
The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), formally Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, establishes horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) typically qualify as such products, often falling under "important" (Annex III) or "critical" (Annex IV) categories due to their role in critical infrastructure, safety, and connectivity. This triggers specific obligations for manufacturers (who design, develop, or produce IACS) and system integrators (who may be deemed manufacturers if they substantially modify products, per Article 22).

Manufacturers and integrators must comply with essential cybersecurity requirements, vulnerability handling, incident reporting, and conformity assessments. Exemptions exist for products under certain Union laws (e.g., medical devices or vehicles), but IACS in industrial contexts are generally covered unless specifically exempted.

Below is a table summarizing the most relevant chapters, sections, and articles, based on their focus on manufacturer obligations, conformity, cybersecurity, vulnerability/incident handling, and rules for critical systems. Relevance is high for core obligations and assessments, medium for surveillance/enforcement, and low for procedural/final aspects.

| Chapter/Section | Relevant Articles | Relevance Level | Why Relevant |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Chapter I: General Provisions** | 1 (Subject matter and scope), 2 (Definitions), 6 (Requirements for products with digital elements), 7 (Important products - Annex III), 8 (Critical products - Annex IV) | High | Defines scope including IACS as connected digital products; classifies IACS as important/critical, requiring enhanced conformity (e.g., third-party assessment for critical IACS); mandates essential cybersecurity requirements (Annex I). |
| **Chapter II: Obligations of Economic Operators and Provisions in Relation to Free and Open-Source Software** | 13 (Obligations of manufacturers), 14 (Reporting obligations), 15 (Voluntary reporting), 16 (Single reporting platform), 21-22 (When importers/distributors are deemed manufacturers), 24 (Other obligations) | High | Outlines manufacturer duties like cybersecurity risk assessments, vulnerability handling processes, minimum 5-year support periods, and 24-hour incident reporting to ENISA (applies from September 2026); integrators may inherit manufacturer roles via modifications; enables voluntary reporting for proactive IACS security. |
| **Chapter III: Conformity of the Product with Digital Elements** | 27 (Presumption of conformity), 28 (EU declaration of conformity), 30 (CE marking), 31 (Technical documentation), 32-34 (General conformity rules) | High | Requires conformity assessments (internal for basic, third-party for important/critical IACS); mandates EU declarations, CE marking, and detailed documentation (Annex VII) to prove compliance with cybersecurity requirements. |
| **Chapter IV: Notification of Conformity Assessment Bodies** | 35-46 (Notification procedures and requirements), 47-51 (Operational obligations of notified bodies) | Medium | Details notified bodies' roles in assessing critical IACS (e.g., EU-type examinations, quality assurance per Annex VIII); applies from June 2026, ensuring independent verification for high-assurance levels. |
| **Chapter V: Market Surveillance and Enforcement** | 52 (Market surveillance), 53-55 (Control of products entering the Union), 56-58 (Union safeguard procedure) | Medium | Establishes surveillance, border controls, and safeguards for non-compliant IACS; allows recalls or bans for significant cybersecurity risks, impacting manufacturers' post-market responsibilities. |
| **Chapter VI: Delegated Powers and Committee Procedure** | 59-62 (Delegated and implementing acts) | Low | Empowers the Commission to update critical product lists or requirements, potentially affecting future IACS classifications. |
| **Chapter VII: Confidentiality and Penalties** | 63 (Confidentiality), 64 (Penalties), 65 (Representative actions) | Medium | Protects sensitive IACS vulnerability data during reporting; sets penalties for non-compliance (e.g., unreported incidents), enforceable via representative actions. |
| **Chapter VIII: Transitional and Final Provisions** | 66-68 (Amendments to other regulations), 69 (Transitional provisions), 70 (Evaluation and review), 71 (Entry into force) | Low | Provides timelines (e.g., full application from 2026-2027) and reviews, allowing manufacturers time to adapt IACS processes. |

### Key Annexes Relevant to IACS
- **Annex I: Essential Cybersecurity Requirements** (Parts I-II): Core for IACS designâ€”covers secure-by-default configurations, data protection, and vulnerability handling processes.
- **Annex III: Important Products with Digital Elements** (Classes I-II): Lists categories like network management tools; IACS may qualify, requiring specific conformity modules.
- **Annex IV: Critical Products with Digital Elements**: Mandates at least "substantial" assurance via certification for high-risk IACS.
- **Annex V-VI: EU Declaration of Conformity**: Templates for IACS compliance statements.
- **Annex VII: Content of Technical Documentation**: Details required for IACS, including risk assessments and SBOMs.
- **Annex VIII: Conformity Assessment Procedures** (Modules A, B+C, H): Specifies internal control or full quality assurance paths for IACS.

For IACS-specific applicability, consult Annexes III-IV to confirm classification, as this determines assessment rigor. Manufacturers should prioritize Articles 13-14 for ongoing obligations like support and reporting.
