### Overview
The Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC (Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery) establishes essential health and safety requirements for the design, manufacture, and placing on the market of machinery, including Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) where they qualify as machinery, partly completed machinery, or safety components (e.g., logic units for safety functions or control systems). IACS manufacturers are responsible for ensuring compliance with essential requirements, risk assessments, technical documentation, and conformity procedures. System integrators may be deemed manufacturers if they assemble or substantially modify machinery (per Article 2), inheriting obligations for integration, safety integration, and CE marking. Key peculiarities for IACS include emphasis on control system reliability, software safety, and high-risk categories requiring third-party assessment (e.g., for automated safety logic).

Exemptions apply to certain products (e.g., low-voltage electrical equipment under other directives), but IACS in industrial contexts often fall within scope unless excluded. The directive will be repealed by the Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 from January 20, 2027, but remains applicable until then.

Below is a table summarizing the most relevant articles and annexes (the directive lacks formal chapters but groups provisions logically). Relevance is high for core obligations and IACS-specific safety, medium for assessment/enforcement, and low for procedural aspects.

| Article/Annex | Relevant Sections | Relevance Level | Why Relevant |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Article 1: Scope** | Full article | High | Determines applicability to IACS as machinery or safety components; excludes certain electrical products but includes automated systems with actuators or safety functions. |
| **Article 2: Definitions** | Definitions of 'machinery', 'safety component', 'partly completed machinery', 'manufacturer' | High | Defines IACS elements (e.g., safety components like logic units) and clarifies integrator roles as manufacturers for assemblies; essential for classifying IACS products. |
| **Article 5: Placing on the market and putting into service** | Full article | High | Requires IACS manufacturers to meet Annex I requirements, prepare technical files, conduct conformity assessments, issue EC declarations, and affix CE marks; peculiarly relevant for ensuring safe integration in automated systems. |
| **Article 12: Procedures for assessing the conformity of machinery** | Procedures including internal checks (Annex VIII), EC type-examination (Annex IX), full quality assurance (Annex X) | High | Mandates enhanced assessments for high-risk IACS (Annex IV categories like logic units); integrators must follow if modifying machinery. |
| **Article 13: Procedure for partly completed machinery** | Full article | High | Applies to IACS supplied as incomplete systems; requires declaration of incorporation and assembly instructions, vital for integrators combining components. |
| **Article 14: Notified bodies** | Requirements for bodies assessing conformity | Medium | Relevant for third-party involvement in high-risk IACS certifications (e.g., Annex IV items). |
| **Article 15: Installation and use of machinery** | Full article | Medium | Allows Member States to set worker protection rules; impacts IACS integrators ensuring safe installation without unauthorized modifications. |
| **Article 16: CE marking** | Full article | Medium | Obliges affixing CE marks on compliant IACS, signaling conformity for manufacturers and integrators. |
| **Annex I: Essential health and safety requirements relating to the design and construction of machinery** | Section 1.1 (General remarks), 1.2 (Control systems: safety/reliability, starting/stopping, failure modes, software), 1.7 (Information: warnings, instructions); Supplementary sections e.g., 3.3 (Control systems for mobile machinery) | High | Core for IACS: Requires control systems to prevent hazardous situations, ensure reliability (e.g., "Control systems must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising"), and validate software; peculiarly addresses automation risks like failures or unintended movements. |
| **Annex IV: Categories of machinery to which one of the procedures referred to in Article 12(3) and (4) must be applied** | Items 19 (Protective devices for detecting persons), 20 (Power-operated interlocking guards), 21 (Logic units to ensure safety functions) | High | Lists high-risk IACS elements (e.g., logic units, guards in automated machinery) requiring notified body involvement; directly peculiar to safety-critical automation. |
| **Annex V: Indicative list of safety components** | Items 2 (Protective devices for detecting persons), 4 (Logic units to ensure safety functions) | High | Identifies IACS as safety components (e.g., logic units), subjecting them to directive requirements. |
| **Annex VI: Assembly instructions for partly completed machinery** | Full annex | Medium | Guides integrators on safe assembly of IACS components into complete machinery. |
| **Annex VII: Technical documentation** | Part A (For machinery: risk assessment, drawings, test reports), Part B (For partly completed machinery) | High | Mandates detailed files for IACS, including risk analyses for control systems; essential for manufacturers to document safety integration. |
| **Annex VIII: Procedure for assessment of conformity with internal checks on the manufacture of machinery** | Full annex | Medium | Applies to low-risk IACS; allows self-assessment by manufacturers. |
| **Annex IX: EC type-examination** & **Annex X: Full quality assurance** | Full annexes | Medium | For high-risk IACS (e.g., Annex IV), requires notified body audits or quality systems; peculiar for ensuring reliable production of automated controls. |

For IACS-specific applicability, prioritize Annex I Section 1.2 for control reliability and Annex IV/V for classification, as these address the unique risks of automation failures. Manufacturers and integrators should conduct risk assessments per Annex I and maintain documentation for at least 10 years.
