Below is a **sample compliance matrix** for Area 4: Compliance on Other Areas of the Standards. This matrix is designed to provide a clear, visual representation of compliance status across the subcategories we defined—Asset Management, Access Control, Incident Response, Operational Security, and Physical and Environmental Security—mapped to IEC 62443, ISO 27001/27002, NIS2, and the EU Machinery Regulation. It includes sample findings from a hypothetical audit of a manufacturing facility with IT servers and OT machinery, showing compliance levels, gaps, and remediation priorities.

### Summary Metrics
- **Overall Compliance**: 12 Yes (48%), 9 Partial (36%), 4 No (16%) out of 25 items.
- **By Standard**:
  - **ISO 27001/27002**: 60% compliant (strong in policy, weak in OT execution).
  - **IEC 62443**: 50% compliant (gaps in OT hardening and monitoring).
  - **NIS2**: 70% compliant (good risk management, weak incident detection).
  - **EU Machinery Regulation**: 40% compliant (design compliance present, but operational gaps).
- **Priority Breakdown**: 7 High, 7 Medium, 11 N/A.

### How to Use the Matrix
1. **Audit Execution**:
   - Fill in the “Compliance Status” and “Evidence/Findings” columns during the audit based on evidence (e.g., logs, interviews, scans).
   - Assign “Remediation Priority” based on risk impact (e.g., OT vulnerabilities = High).

2. **Reporting**:
   - Present the matrix to stakeholders with color coding (e.g., Green = Yes, Yellow = Partial, Red = No).
   - Highlight high-priority items for immediate action (e.g., “Secure PLC passwords”).
   - Summarize compliance percentages per standard for executive reporting.

3. **Remediation Planning**:
   - Group high-priority items into a remediation roadmap (e.g., “Q2 2025: Harden OT systems”).
   - Tie gaps to specific controls for traceability (e.g., “OT patching → IEC 62443-2-1 SR 2.4”).

---

### Example Insights from the Matrix
- **Strengths**: Strong policy framework (e.g., access control policy, incident response plan) and physical visitor controls.
- **Weaknesses**: OT-specific gaps (e.g., unpatched PLCs, no OT monitoring, default passwords) and inconsistent machinery security processes.
- **Priorities**: Immediate fixes needed for OT access control, patching, and physical security to align with IEC 62443 and NIS2.

---

### Customization Tips
- **Add Weights**: Assign scores (e.g., Yes = 2, Partial = 1, No = 0) and weight critical items higher (e.g., patching > visitor logs) for a weighted compliance score.
- **Expand**: Add more items specific to your context (e.g., supply chain security for NIS2).
- **Automate**: Export to a tool like Excel or Power BI for dynamic filtering and visualization.

Would you like me to refine this further (e.g., add a weighted scoring system), provide a downloadable template (e.g., CSV format), or focus on a specific standard’s gaps? Let me know how to tailor it!
