ITTF format 

A Brief Introduction

We present a simple text-based formatt called ITTF, designed to represent complex information nodes 
by using indentation to express hierarchical relationships. 

Here are the basic rules:

1) Keyword and Value
Each line begins with a keyword that indicates the meaning of the data, followed by its value, separated by a space or a tab. For example:

```ittf
address Via E.torricelli
```

2) Hierarchy Through Indentation
Any lines that are indented relative to the line above are considered its “child” nodes.

3) Complex Entities
Every node describing a complex entity has exactly one parent node that provides the entity’s name and, optionally, its ID. 
The child nodes under it contain the other attributes and their values.

4) Child Nodes
A child node can represent either a single attribute or another complex entity.

Below is an example of how to represent a product order to a supplier using the ITTF format
    
```ittf
supplier
    name ABC S.p.A.
    address Via Roma 10
    town Milano
    CAP 20100
    country Italia
    order
        number 12345
        data 2023-10-05
        product
            code P001
            description Laptop
            quantity 10
            price 1500.00
        product
            code P002
            description Mouse
            quantity 50
            price 40.00
        total 15200.00
```

We guess that between supplier and order there is a one-to-many relationship and the same is between order and product.
But an ITTF document do not express relations and neither any schema information.
It will be the Wizzi Schema that will be applied to the document that will express the meaning of node names
indicating entities, attributes and relations.

The Wizzi schema is described in the file `Wizzi schema.txt`

Wizzi schemas are applied to ITTF document through the name of the file that stores it:
- a file `profile.html.ittf` has a wizzi schema named `html`.
All ITTF document have extension `*.ittf`, the file name segment before the extension is the name of the wizzi schema.
