        <h1>SM-1 - Development process</h1>
        <div>A general product development/maintenance/support process shall be documented and enforced that is consistent and integrated with commonly accepted product development processes that include, but are not limited to: a) configuration management with change controls and audit logging; b) product description and requirements definition with requirements traceability; c) software or hardware design and implementation practices, such as modular design; d) repeatable testing verification and validation process; e) review and approval of all development process records; and f) life-cycle support.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that the product supplier has well-defined and proven product development processes in place that can be extended to support the requirements specified by this document. The required processes defined by this document assume the existence of a mature product development life-cycle. Secure product development life-cycles cannot be effective without these processes and rely upon them being in place. Examples of commonly accepted product development processes include ISO 9001 [13] and ISO/IEC 27034 [34] compliant processes. Having this process means that the product supplier uses techniques during the product development life-cycle that support, as a minimum, configuration management, requirements definition, design, implementation and testing.</div>
        <h3>Configuration Management with Change Controls and Audit Logging</h3>
        <div>a) configuration management with change controls and audit logging;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of establishing a configuration management process that incorporates change controls and audit logging to ensure changes to the product or system are properly managed, documented, and traceable. The process should safeguard against unauthorized alterations and facilitate the detection and correction of any issues arising from changes.</div>
        <h3>Product Description and Requirements Definition with Requirements Traceability</h3>
        <div>b) product description and requirements definition with requirements traceability;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of clearly defining the product description and its security requirements during the development process. It also mandates maintaining traceability of these requirements throughout the development lifecycle to ensure that security considerations are consistently addressed and implemented.</div>
        <h3>Development Process - Software or Hardware Design and Implementation Practices</h3>
        <div>c) software or hardware design and implementation practices, such as modular design;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the adoption of design and implementation practices that enhance the security of software or hardware. Specifically, it emphasizes the use of modular design to improve manageability, scalability, and security throughout the development process.</div>
        <h3>Repeatable Testing Verification and Validation Process</h3>
        <div>d) repeatable testing verification and validation process;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the need for a structured and repeatable process for the verification and validation of security measures during the development of industrial automation and control systems. The goal is to ensure that security functionalities are consistently tested and validated to meet the defined security requirements.</div>
        <h3>Review and Approval of Development Process Records</h3>
        <div>e) review and approval of all development process records;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the systematic review and approval of all records generated during the development process, ensuring they meet specified criteria and are compliant with security standards. It involves establishing procedures for the documentation and verification of security measures throughout the product development lifecycle.</div>
        <h3>Life-cycle Support</h3>
        <div>f) life-cycle support.</div>
        <div>This requirement under IEC 62443-4-1 focuses on ensuring that cybersecurity considerations are integrated throughout the entire life-cycle of the product. This involves planning and executing security activities from the initial design phase through maintenance and eventual retirement of the system.</div>
        <h3>SP.800-218 Implement Supporting Toolchains (PO.3): Use automation to reduce human effort and improve the accuracy, reproducibility, usability, and comprehensiveness of security practices throughout the SDLC, as well as provide a way to document and demonstrate the use of these practices. Toolchains and tools may be used at different levels of the organization, such as organization-wide or project-specific, and may address a particular part of the SDLC, like a build pipeline.</h3>
        <div>PO.3.1: Specify which tools or tool types must or should be included in each toolchain to mitigate identified risks, as well as how the toolchain components are to be integrated with each other.</div>
        <h5>examples</h5>
        <div>Example 1: Define categories of toolchains, and specify the mandatory tools or tool types to be used for each category.</div>
        <div>Example 2: Identify security tools to integrate into the developer toolchain.</div>
        <div>Example 3: Define what information is to be passed between tools and what data formats are to be used.</div>
        <div>Example 4: Evaluate tools’ signing capabilities to create immutable records/logs for auditability within the toolchain.</div>
        <div>Example 5: Use automated technology for toolchain management and orchestration.</div>

        <div>A process shall be employed for identifying products (or parts of products) to which this document applies.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that the processes in scope as part of this document are applied to the appropriate products as needed and that the correct level of detail is applied. Having this process means that the product supplier has criteria for identifying which of its products are to be developed, maintained and supported using the processes required by this document. It is envisioned that a product supplier may apply this specification to selected products based on a number of factors, including the marketplace for which a product is intended and whether or not the product requires security to be built in to the product and fully evaluated. As an example, certain products or components may not have a security context or provide anonymous access and therefore may not require security to be built in to the product. An organization may also base the criteria on the particular features being developed to enhance a product for target markets as long as the common features for all markets remain subject to this standard. Organizations may also use criteria such as applicable security requirements or security risk. These requirements may be applied to externally provided components or custom developed components from third party suppliers. See 5.11 and 5.12 for more details.</div>

        <div>This process is required to ensure that personnel involved in security-related processes have adequate expertise for the specific tasks to which they are assigned. Expertise can have been gained by training, experience, seminars, conferences, certifications, etc. this includes technical expertise in defense in depth strategies and related security techniques, and also in the practices, including best practices, required to develop and mainta in the product. Having this process means that personnel assigned to security-related processes have evidence that shows their relevant qualifications. This includes knowledge not only of security, but also for the use of any security-related standards (for example, coding standards), techniques (for example, best practices), and tools (for example, static analysis tools). While security awareness training is vital for everyone involved in the secure product life-cycle, it is generally insufficient for personnel involved in security requirements analysis, design reviews, etc. The security training is role-specific and can vary in formality from informal to formal. Similarly, the personnel assigned to security-related processes have experience (for example, past projects and number of years) that matches the specific security tasks and their specific role.</div>

For example, the ability of an attacker to insert an infection in the binary code of a product could lead to that infection being distributed as part of the released product. Having this process means that the product supplier has mechanisms in place to protect the integrity of design documents, the product implementation (for example, code and user manuals), configuration settings and private keys used for signing software images. For example, application of ISO/IEC 27001 [20] and ISO/IEC 27002 [19] policies and controls can reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to source code or corruption of source code. They can also reduce the likelihood of unauthorized disclosure of product designs and test results that could be used to compromise fielded versions of the product. Items to specially safeguard include authenticators (e. g., passwords, access control lists, code signing certificates and exploit records collected during defect management).</div>

        <h1>SM-9 - Security requirements for externally provided components</h1>
        <div>A process shall be employed to identify and manage the security risks of all externally provided components used within the product.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that supply chain security is addressed for equivalent security practices, latest security updates, security deployment guides and the supplier’s ability to respond if a vulnerability is discovered. Supply chain security applies to components which are included within the product and are provided external to the development team responsible for a given product, but do not meet the definition described in 5.12. The security provided by such third-party components is directly related to their role in the product's secure design and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7). Having this process means that the product supplier is able to identify when one or more of the following characteristics apply to the use of third-party components in the product: a) the degree to which the component aligns with the product’s security context (see Clause 6) and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7); b) the degree of rigor applied to the component’s implementation (see Clause 8); c) the degree of security verification and validation performed on the component by the product supplier or the component supplier (see Clause 9); d) how to receive and/or monitor notifications about security-related issues from the component supplier (see Clause 10) and patches (see Clause 11); and e) the sufficiency of security documentation for the component (see Clause 12). f) the degree that the software is currently supported by the supplier or open source community. Examples of work items that would satisfy some elements of this requirement include: – identifying known vulnerabilities in specific versions of open source software components and updating the version of the open source components to the version that fixes the vulnerability; – evaluating the compliance of vendors of commercial off the shelf (COTS) components to this document or a similar SDL standard; and – employing compensating mechanisms for known vulnerabilities on COTS or open source components (such as static code analysis). It is recommended that there be an inventory of components from third party suppliers in order to facilitate defect management (see Clause 6).

        <div>A process shall be employed for continuously improving the SDL. This process shall include the analysis of security defects in component/subsystem/system technologies that escape to the field.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that product suppliers improve the rigor of their SDL over time. New security threats are constantly being identified and exploited by attackers so it is important product suppliers help compensate for this by continuously improving their SDL. Continuous improvement is a well-established and proven method of improving product quality. Since product security issues are a type of quality issue, conti nuous improvement methodologies are applicable to an SDL. See Annex A for potential metrics related to SDL effectiveness and improvement. Having this process means that the supplier has a procedure in place to review the process and security defects that escape to the field on a periodic basis and that this procedure includes making improvements to the process as a result of these reviews. Some examples of activities that would help improve a product supplier’s SDL are included in Table 2. Ultimately it is up to suppliers to implement their own means of continuously improving their SDL. Table 2 – Example SDL continuous improvement activities Activity SDL / security benefits Use a known security vulnerability database to help improve the threat model. For example, if the threat model indicates that the product uses the TLS protocol for transport security, review known vulnerabilities in TLS implementations and ensure these are mitigated in the design. Improves the threat model by keeping it current with actual security issues observed in the field. Attend external security / SDL conferences or participate in industry SDL groups such as OWASP Helps a product supplier stay current with emerging threats and SDL best practices. Conduct internal SDL conferences or sessions for sharing of SDL expertise and best practices within the product supplier’s organization. Improve the overall SDL expertise of the product supplier’ s employees and hel p them stay current with emerg ing security threats and SDL best practices. Perform SDL root cause analysis for security vulnerabilities found externally in a supplier’ s product and identify p l us implement correcti ve action. Al l SDL practices shou ld be in scope for this analysis. Root cause analysis and corrective action is a well-established method for improving product quality. Since security issues are quality issues it works well for an SDL too. Combine manual penetration testing with automated tool base testing or use multiple similar security testing tools for SVV-3 vulnerability testing. Improves test coverage relative to using a single automated tool. This becomes especially valuable after the existing automated tool stops finding new vulnerabilities. Create fuzzing tools for any protocols for which tools are not available. Help avoid the scenario where an attacker develops its own fuzzing tool and uses it to find and exploit security vulnerabilities in a product. Train and use dedicated security testing experts for SVV-3 vulnerability testing. Since security vulnerability requires extensive and constantly growing expertise, developing and using dedicated experts will improve security test coverage.</div>

        <h1>SR-1 - Product security context</h1>
        <div>A process shall be employed to ensure that the intended product security context is documented.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that the minimum requirements of the environment and the assumptions about that environment are documented in order to ach ieve the security level for which the product was designed. The purpose of defin ing this in formation is so that both the developers of the product and the product users have the same understand ing about how the product is intended to be used. this will he lp the developers make appropriate design decis ions and the users to use the product as it was intended. security context could include: a) l ocation in the network; b) physical or cyber security provided by the environment where the product will be deployed; c) isolation (from a network perspective); and d) if known, potential impact to the environment (for example, loss of life, injury, loss of production, etc.). For example, it is important to document whether physical security is required. If no physical security is expected to be present, then that may add a number of related requirements such as not allowing push button configuration on the product. Another example is if the product is expected to be protected by a user supplied firewall that connects it to the plant network, the product would typically not require a firewall of its own. Documenting these external security features for the product (its security context) allows developers to design a defense in depth strategy that complements this security context and testers to validate and verify the security of a product in an environment similar to how it shou ld be deployed. Having this process means that the deployment environment in which the product is intended to be used is correctly represented in all processes involved in the development and testing of this product and are documented.</div>

        <div>A process shall be employed to ensure that all products shall have a threat model specific to the current development scope of the product with the following characteristics (where applicable): a) correct flow of categorized information throughout the system; b) trust boundaries; c) processes; d) data stores; e) interacting external entities; f) internal and external communication protocols implemented in the product; g) externally accessible physical ports including debug ports; h) circuit board connections such as Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) connections or debug headers which might be used to attack the hardware; i) potential attack vectors including attacks on the hardware, if applicable; j) potential threats and their severity as defined by a vulnerability scoring system (for example, CVSS); k) mitigations and/or dispositions for each threat; l) security-related issues identified; and m) external dependencies in the form of d rivers or third-party applications (code that is not developed by the supplier) that are linked in to the application. The threat model shall be reviewed and verified by the development team to ensure that it is correct and understood. The threat model shall be reviewed periodically (at least once a year) for released products and updated if required in response to the emergence of new threats to the product even if the design does not change. Any issues identified in the threat model shall be addressed as defined in 10.4 and 10.5.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that security threats for the product are identified, validated, documented, addressed and tested by the product's project team according to the defense in depth strategy. Having this process means that a threat model for the product is defined and maintained throughout the product life-cycle (for example, as a result of changing threats or updates to the defense in depth strategy) that identifies and describes threats that can occur within the product security context, and against which product is expected to defend itself. External dependencies are external components or systems that the product depends upon for security. As an example, a product could depend on power for physical security. Or a product could depend on the session management of a web server to be secure. In these examples, failure of the external dependency could lead to a security vulnerability in the product, so mitigations need to be put in place to minimize the chances of such failures. So for the power example, the mitigation could be the installation of an un interruptable power supply (UPS). In the example of a web server, security should be considered when choosing a web server, and if a secure web server cannot be found, then other compensating measures need to be considered. Third-party code is an external dependency that can present significant challenges in determining where the threats can occur. If deeply embedded there might not be access to/from this code that crosses a trust boundary. If there is access to the trust boundary, a deeper inspection of the third-party code can be needed.</div>

    <div id="SD-1" class="content-section">
        <h1>SD-1 - Secure design principles</h1>
        <div>A process shall be employed for developing and documenting a secure design that identifies and characterizes each interface of the product, including physical and logical interfaces, to include: a) an indication of whether the interface is externally accessible (by other products), or internally accessible (by other components of the product), or both; b) security implications of the product security context (see Clause 6) on the external interface; c) potential users of the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it (directly or indirectly); d) a determination of whether access to the interface crosses a trust boundary; e) security considerations, assumptions and/or constraints associated with the use of the interface within the product security context, including applicable threats; f) the security roles, privileges/rights and access control permissions needed to use the interface and to access the assets defined in c) above; g) the security capabilities and/or compensating mechanisms used to safeguard the interface and the assets defined in c) above, including input validation as well as output and error handling; h) the use of third-party products to implement the interface and their security capabilities; i) documentation that describes how to use the interface if it is externally accessible; and j) description of how the design mitigates the threats identified in the threat model.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that security for access to assets is comprehensively addressed from the perspective of external and internal interfaces of the product through which attacks can be mounted. Having this process means that interfaces of the product are identified and characterized by the interactions that take place over them (for example, data and control flows), the security mechanisms designed to protect them and the assets that can be compromised if not adequately protected. Interfaces include physical and wireless connections to networks (for example, Ethernet) and devices (for example, keyboards, monitors and USB/compact disc [CD]/digital versatile disc [DVD] media). Logical interfaces support data control flows (for example, application messaging) between product components and include mechanisms such as application programming interfaces (for example, structured queryl anguage [SQL]) and communications protocols (for example, the transmission control protocol [TCP]). Protection mechanisms include general hardening capabilities (for example, security policy settings), user access controls (for example, account management), and security event detection and reporting, among others. Viewing interfaces within the setting provided by the product security context allows the secure design to focus on the specific environment in which the product is expected to operate, including both protections offered by the product security context and vulnerabilities resulting from it (for example, where it can be open to attack). For an internal component of the design, the concept of the product security context is extended to include the security context provided by surround ing product components. For example, the product security context of an application program running on a workstation that is part of an industrial control system product includes the network(s) to which the workstation connects and the software environment of the workstation in which the application runs. Identifying threats, users, assets and trust boundaries associated withinterfaces specifies who is expected to use the interfaces, and indicates where threats and unknown subjects potentially can ga in access to the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it. This allows the reduction of the number of interfaces where possible and to provide the appropriate safeguards for the remaining interfaces and the assets that can be accessed through them. Identifying trust boundaries also supports future definition of zones and conduits (see IEC 62443-3-2 [9]), and thus is a primary component in the definition of the security architecture of the product. Sample data assets (resources) include: a) databases and database tables; b) configuration files; c) cryptographic key stores; d) access control lists (ACLs); e) registry keys; f) web pages (static and dynamic); g) audit logs; h) network sockets / network media; i) inter-process communications (IPC), services and remote procedure call (RPC) resources; j) any other files and directories; and k) any other memory resource. Based on analysis of the product security requirements, the product security context and trust boundary considerations, the design can be developed for interfaces that include the definition of user roles, privileges and authorization/access permissions required to use the interfaces as well as specific security capabilities (for example, authentication, encryption and logging) that provide additional safeguards. As part of the design of the defense in depth strategy, the expected use of compensating mechanisms and third-party hardware or software components will aid in the assessment of the adequacy of the defense in depth strategy (see 7.4). Finally, preparing documentation for the use of externally accessible interfaces (for example, by users and third-parties) reduces the potential for accidental misuse.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Principles - Interface Accessibility</h3>
        <div>a) an indication of whether the interface is externally accessible (by other products), or internally accessible (by other components of the product), or both;</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the identification of whether an interface is externally accessible by other products or internally accessible by other components of the product, or both. It emphasizes the importance of clearly defining the accessibility scope of interfaces to ensure secure design.</div>
        <h3>Security Implications of the Product Security Context on the External Interface</h3>
        <div>b) security implications of the product security context (see Clause 6, Practice 2 – Specification of security requirements) on the external interface;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on understanding and addressing the security implications that arise from the product security context, particularly with respect to the external interfaces. It is crucial for ensuring that the product is designed with security considerations that account for how it interacts with external systems and networks.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Principles - Potential Users and Asset Access</h3>
        <div>c) potential users of the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it (directly or indirectly);</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the identification and consideration of potential users of an interface and the assets accessible through it, either directly or indirectly, during the secure design process. It is crucial to understand who might interact with the system and the level of access they may have, to ensure that security measures are appropriately implemented.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Principles - Trust Boundary Consideration</h3>
        <div>d) a determination of whether access to the interface crosses a trust boundary;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on evaluating whether access to an interface crosses a trust boundary in the context of industrial automation and control systems (IACS). A trust boundary is a point in a system where data or control transitions between domains of differing trust levels. Identifying these boundaries is crucial to ensure that interfaces are secured appropriately to prevent unauthorized access and potential threats.</div>
        <h3>Security Considerations for Interfaces</h3>
        <div>e) security considerations, assumptions and/or constraints associated with the use of the interface within the product security context, including applicable threats;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on identifying and documenting the security considerations, assumptions, and constraints associated with using interfaces within the product's security context. This involves understanding the potential threats applicable to these interfaces and ensuring that they are accounted for in the design process.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Principles - Security Roles, Privileges/Rights, and Access Control Permissions</h3>
        <div>f) the security roles, privileges/rights and access control permissions needed to use the interface and to access the assets defined in c) above;</div>
        <div>This requirement outlines the need to define security roles, privileges, rights, and access control permissions necessary for using interfaces and accessing assets. It ensures that only authorized users can interact with specific system components, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</div>
        <h3>Security Capabilities and Compensating Mechanisms</h3>
        <div>g) the security capabilities and/or compensating mechanisms used to safeguard the interface and the assets defined in c) above, including input validation as well as output and error handling;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the implementation of security capabilities and compensating mechanisms to protect interfaces and assets. It specifically emphasizes input validation, output handling, and error management to ensure robust security. These mechanisms are vital for safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system.</div>
        <h3>Use of Third-Party Products and Their Security Capabilities</h3>
        <div>h) the use of third-party products to implement the interface and their security capabilities;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of evaluating and integrating third-party products with a focus on their security capabilities when implementing interfaces within industrial automation and control systems. It highlights the necessity to ensure that third-party components comply with secure design principles to maintain the overall security posture of the system.</div>
        <h3>Documentation for Externally Accessible Interfaces</h3>
        <div>i) documentation that describes how to use the interface if it is externally accessible ; and</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the need to provide comprehensive documentation for any interfaces that are accessible externally. This documentation should guide users on how to securely interact with these interfaces, ensuring that security is maintained during their use.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Principles</h3>
        <div>j) description of how the design mitigates the threats identified in the threat model.</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the inclusion of secure design principles in the system development lifecycle, particularly emphasizing the need to describe how the design addresses and mitigates threats identified in the threat model.</div>
        <h3>SP.800-218 Design Software to Meet Security Requirements and Mitigate Security Risks (PW.1): Identify and evaluate the security requirements for the software; determine what security risks the software is likely to face during operation and how the software’s design and architecture should mitigate those risks; and justify any cases where risk-based analysis indicates that security requirements should be relaxed or waived.

        <h1>SD-4 - Secure design best practices</h1>
        <div>A process shall be employed to ensure that secure design best practices are documented and applied to the design process. These practices shall be periodically reviewed and updated. Secure design practices include but are not limited to: a) least privilege (granting only the privileges to users/software necessary to perform intended operations); b) using proven secure components/designs where possible; c) economy of mechanism (striving for simple designs); d) using secure design patterns; e) attack surface reduction; f) documenting all trust boundaries as part of the design; and g) removing debug ports, headers and traces from circuit boards used during development from production hardware or documenting their presence and the need to protect them from unauthorized access.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that guidance is provided to developers to help them avoid common pitfalls during design that could lead to later security issues. Having this process means that the product supplier has a list of security best practices that is maintained and followed during the development of the secure design for the product. These best practices should be based commonly accepted security best practices in industry for the type of product being developed. It is completely up to the supplier to determine which practices they consider to be most appropriate for their design practices. These practices are kept current as a result of both changes in the industry and the application of lessons learned by the product supplier. Note that these practices apply to both hardware and software design.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Best Practices - Least Privilege</h3>
        <div>a) least privilege (granting only the privileges to users/software necessary to perform intended operations)</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of applying the principle of least privilege in the design of industrial automation and control systems. It involves granting users and software only the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions, minimizing potential attack vectors and reducing the impact of security breaches.</div>
        <h3>Use Proven Secure Components/Designs</h3>
        <div>b) using proven secure components/designs where possible;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of integrating verified secure components and designs within the system development lifecycle to enhance the security posture of industrial automation and control systems (IACS). By leveraging components and designs that have been rigorously tested and proven to be secure, organizations can mitigate potential vulnerabilities and improve overall system resilience.</div>
        <h3>Economy of Mechanism in Secure Design</h3>
        <div>c) economy of mechanism (striving for simple designs);</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of simplicity in the design of secure systems. By striving for simpler designs, the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities decreases, as simpler systems are generally easier to understand, analyze, and validate. This aligns with the principle of 'economy of mechanism', which advocates for minimizing complexity to enhance security.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Best Practices - Using Secure Design Patterns</h3>
        <div>d) using secure design patterns;</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the use of secure design patterns during the development of industrial control systems and components to mitigate security risks effectively. Secure design patterns are established solutions to common security problems and are used to ensure that security is inherently considered throughout the design phase.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Best Practices: Attack Surface Reduction</h3>
        <div>e) attack surface reduction;</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the application of best practices in secure design to minimize the attack surface of a product. By reducing the attack surface, developers limit the number of potential entry points for an unauthorized user, thereby enhancing the product's security posture.</div>
        <h3>Documenting Trust Boundaries</h3>
        <div>f) all trust boundaries are documented as part of the design; and</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the documentation of all trust boundaries within a system as part of the secure design process. Trust boundaries separate zones of differing trust levels within an industrial control system, and documenting them is crucial to ensure security measures are appropriately applied and managed.</div>
        <h3>Secure Design Best Practices: Debug Port Management</h3>
        <div>g) removing debug ports, headers and traces from circuit boards used during development from production hardware or documenting their presence and the need to protect them from unauthorized access.</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the removal of debug ports, headers, and traces from circuit boards that were used during development in the final production hardware. Alternatively, if these components are retained, their presence must be documented, and measures must be in place to protect them from unauthorized access.</div>
        <h3>SP.800-218 Define Security Requirements for Software Development (PO.1): Ensure that security requirements for software development are known at all times so that they can be taken into account throughout the SDLC and duplication of effort can be minimized because the requirements information can be collected once and shared.

        <h1>SI-2 - Secure coding standards</h1>
        <div>The implementation processes shall incorporate security coding standards that are periodically reviewed and updated and include at a minimum: a) avoidance of potentially exploitable implementation constructs – implementation design patterns that are known to have security weaknesses; b) avoidance of banned functions and coding constructs/design patterns – software functions and design patterns that shou ld not be used because they have known security weaknesses; c) automated tool use and settings (for example, for static analysis tools); d) secure coding practices; e) validation of all inputs that cross trust boundary. f) error handling.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that guidance is provided to developers to help them avoid common pitfalls during implementation that could lead to later security issues. Having this process means that the product supplier has a list of security best practices that it maintains and follows during the implementation of a product. These best practices should be based on commonly accepted security best practices in industry for the type of product being developed. It is completely up to the supplier to determine which practices they consider to be most appropriate for their design and coding standard. These practices are kept current as a result of both changes in the industry and the application of lessons learned by the product supplier.</div>

        <div>A process shall be employed to identify and characterize security-related issues via tests that focus on discovering and exploiting security vulnerabilities in the product.</div>
        <div>Penetration testing focuses specifically on compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the product. It can involve defeating multiple aspects of the defense in depth design. For example, bypassing authentication to access the product, using elevation of privilege to gain administrative access and then compromising confidentiality by breaking encryption. As this example shows, penetration testing involves approaching testing like an attacker and often involves exploiting chained vulnerabilities in a product. This process is required to ensure that efforts have been taken to discover security-related issues in the product or product documentation that could allow the product to be exploited. Having this process means that the product supplier attempts to breach the security of the product through penetration testing. Penetration testing consists of confirm ing that vulnerabilities in any product capability or the defense in depth strategy can be exploited and used to compromise security of the product. It requires in depth knowledge of the type of product being tested along with security testing tools and techniques. Penetration testing can involve the use of manual techniques, test tools or combinations of the two.</div>

        <div>A process shall be employed to ensure that individuals performing testing are independent from the developers who designed and implemented the product according to Table 3. Table 3 – Required level of independence of testers from developers Test type | Reference | Level of independence Security requirements testing | SVV-1 – security requirements testing | Independent department Threat mitigation testing | SVV-2 – Threat mitigation testing | Independent department Abuse case testing | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Static code analysis | SI-1 – Security implementation review | None Attack surface analysis | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Known vulnerability scanning | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Software composition analysis | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | None Penetration testing | SVV-4 – Penetration testing | Independent department or organization The levels of independence are defined as follows: None – no independence required. Developer can perform the testing. Independent person – the person who performs the testing cannot be one of the developers of the product. Independent department – the person who performs the testing cannot report to the same fi rst line manager as any developers of the product. Al ternatively, they could be a member of a qua l ity assurance (QA) department. Independent organization – the person who performs the testing cannot be part of the same organization as any developers of the product. An organization can be a separate l egal en ti ty, a d i vi s ion of a company or a departmen t of a company that reports to a different executive such as a vice president or s im i lar level.</div>
        <div>An independent tester can often find out more, other and different defects than a tester working within a programming team – or a tester who is by profession a programmer. Such a tester brings a different set of assumptions to testing and to reviews, which often helps in exposing the hidden defects and problems. In addition, an independent tester who reports to senior management can report his results honestly and without any concern for reprisal that might result from pointing out problems in co-workers’ or, worse yet, the manager’s work. Add itional security defects can often be found when a tester’s black-box level knowledge of the product is supplemented with whi te-box level knowledge of a developer acting as an advisor to the tester.</div>

        <div>A process shall exist for ensuring that reported security-related issues are investigated in a timely manner to determine their: a) applicability to the product; b) verifiability; and c) threats that trigger the issue.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that security-related issues reported to the product supplier are examined to determine that they are applicable to the product, are verifiable, and that the cause of the issue (such as the threat(s)) is understood. Having this process means that the product supplier verifies all security issues reported to it. Perceived security-related issues can be unsubstan tiated or not applicable to the product, so there needs to be a process to verify and exam ine reported vulnerabilities (see ISO/IEC 301 1 1). For security-related issues in components maintained by the product developer, this process can involve such activities as attempting to reproduce the reported vulnerability or examining the third-party embedded source code’s usage within the product. For security-related issues in components maintained by a third-party, this process can be as stra igh tforward as comparing the version of the third-party binary with the versions to which the patch applies.</div>
        <h3>Reviewing Security-Related Issues</h3>
        <div>a) applicability to the product;</div>
        <div>This requirement pertains to the management of security-related issues specifically in the context of industrial automation and control systems (IACS) product development. It focuses on the processes and practices required to ensure that security vulnerabilities and issues are adequately reviewed, assessed, and addressed to maintain the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the product.</div>

        <div>b) verifiability; and</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on ensuring that security-related issues are addressed in a verifiable manner. It mandates that issues identified in the security development lifecycle are not only resolved but also that their resolution can be verified through appropriate means.</div>
        <h3>Reviewing Security-Related Issues: Threats That Trigger the Issue</h3>
        <div>c) threats that trigger the issue.</div>
        <div>This requirement involves the process of identifying, analyzing, and reviewing threats that could trigger security-related issues within an industrial automation and control system (IACS).

        <h1>DM-3 - Assessing security-related issues</h1>
        <div>A process shall be employed for analysing security-related issues in the product to include: a) assessing their impact with respect to: 1) the actual security context in which they were discovered; 2) the product’s security context (see Clause 6); and 3) the product’s defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7); b) severity as defined by a vulnerability scoring system (for example, CVSS); c) identifying all other products/product versions containing the security-related issue (if any); d) identifying the root causes of the issue; and e) identifying related security issues. For root cause analysis, a methodical approach such as that described in IEC 62740 [25] may be employed.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that the potential impact of security-related design issues is examined and understood to support decis ions related to how they will be addressed. Having this process means that the product supplier assesses the potential impact and severity of each security-related issue, determines whether the issues exist in other products or versions (for example, by using the same or similar components) and identifies the root causes of the issue. Completing such an assessment provides the basis for determining how to address the issue (see 1 0.5), and which development life-cycle processes, such as redesign activi ti es and threat model updates, may be involved in the resolution. Verifiable security-related issues can vary widely in their security impact and their distribution within the product, so there needs to be a process for characterizing each issue so that an appropriate resolution can be determined. It is recommended that the process identify conditions that would exit the security defect management process such as duplicate, non-security, and third-party security-related issues (see ISO/IEC 301 1 1). The impact assessment should also take into consideration additional factors such as the scope of affected product users, the potential for collateral damage, the availability of exploits and (for control systems) the potential impact to essential functions (see IEC 62443-3-3). The impact assessment may be as simple as a qualitative rating (for example, low, medium and high), a more quantitative method based on likelihood and consequence or a standardized method such as the CVSS. A security-related issue that is associated with a widely used design pattern or implementation method can be symptomatic of a larger problem. In such a situation, the impact assessment associated with the vulnerability should address the combined impact of all instances rather than dealing with each instance in isolation.</div>
        <h3>Assessing Security-Related Issues - Assessing Impact</h3>
        <div>a) assessing their impact with respect to:</div>
        <div>This requirement is part of the 'Management of Security-Related Issues' practice within the IEC 62443-4-1 standard. It focuses on assessing the impact of identified security-related issues. This assessment is crucial in understanding how these issues affect the security posture of the industrial automation and control systems (IACS) and influences decision-making regarding mitigation strategies.</div>
        <h3>Assessing Security-Related Issues: Actual Security Context</h3>
        <div>1) the actual security context in which they were discovered;</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on assessing security-related issues by understanding the actual context in which they were discovered. It emphasizes the importance of analyzing the environment and conditions under which a security issue emerged to accurately assess its impact and prioritize remediation efforts.</div>
        <h3>Assessing Security-Related Issues: Product’s Security Context</h3>
        <div>2) the product’s security context; and</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the importance of assessing security-related issues within the context of the product's operational environment. It is crucial to understand how the product interacts with other systems, the potential threats it may face, and the overall security posture it must maintain to ensure robust protection against vulnerabilities.</div>
        <h3>Assessing Security-Related Issues: Product’s Defense in Depth Strategy</h3>
        <div>3) the product’s defense in depth strategy ;</div>
        <div>This requirement emphasizes the need for evaluating the defense in depth strategy of a product to ensure it is capable of addressing security-related issues effectively. Defense in depth involves multiple layers of security controls and measures that collectively protect the product from various threats. The strategy should be assessed to identify potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the layers are robust enough to withstand attacks.</div>
        <h3>Assessing Security-Related Issues - Severity Assessment</h3>
        <div>b) severity as defined by a vulnerability scoring system (for example, CVSS);</div>
        <div>This requirement involves the assessment of security-related issues by determining their severity using a standardized vulnerability scoring system, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The goal is to prioritize the handling of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact on the system.</div>
        <h3>Identifying All Other Products/Product Versions Containing the Security-Related Issue</h3>
        <div>c) identifying all other products/product versions containing the security-related issue (if any);</div>
        <div>This requirement mandates the identification of all other products and product versions that may be affected by a discovered security-related issue. This is a crucial step in managing security-related issues effectively by ensuring that all impacted products are accounted for and addressed.</div>
        <h3>Identifying the Root Causes of Security-Related Issues</h3>
        <div>d) identifying the root causes of the issue; and</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the critical task of determining the underlying reasons for security-related issues in industrial automation and control systems (IACS). Identifying root causes is essential to effectively address and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring the ongoing security and resilience of these systems.</div>

        <div>e) identifying related security issues.</div>
        <div>This requirement focuses on the identification of security-related issues that are interconnected or have implications on other security concerns within the development lifecycle of industrial automation and control systems (IACS). It is part of the broader practice of managing security-related issues to ensure comprehensive security coverage and mitigation strategies.</div>
        <h3>SP.800-218 Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities on an Ongoing Basis (RV.1): Help ensure that vulnerabilities are identified more quickly so that they can be remediated more quickly in accordance with risk, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.</h3>
        <div>RV.1.1: Gather information from software acquirers, users, and public sources on potential vulnerabilities in the software and third-party components that the software uses, and investigate all credible reports.</div>
        <h5>examples</h5>
        <div>Example 1: Monitor vulnerability databases , security mailing lists, and other sources of vulnerability reports through manual or automated means.</div>
        <div>Example 2: Use threat intelligence sources to better understand how vulnerabilities in general are being exploited.</div>
        <div>Example 3: Automatically review provenance and software composition data for all software components to identify any new vulnerabilities they have.</div>

This periodic review shall at a minimum occur during each release or iteration cycle.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that a determination is made for how to handle (address) each security-related issue and that no security-related issue is inadvertently overlooked or ignored. Having this process means that the product supplier reviews the potential residual risk of each security-related issue and makes a justifiable decision for how to handle (address) it. Residual risk can be determined using many different methods. An example would be to start with CVSS score, but then add other security controls and countermeasures not accounted for in CVSS such as whether the issue is applicable to the product’s security context. The process for deciding upon and implementing a resolution to a security-related issue needs to address these considerations (see ISO/IEC 301 1 1) because of their potential impact: a) a proposed resolution can violate a premise of the secure design that other aspects of the product rely upon; b) a proposed resolution can be unnecessary because of a m ismatch between the reporting entity’ s security context and the product security context; c) a proposed resolution can only partially reduce the impact of the security-related issue, may take an unacceptably long time to implement because of its complexi ty, or may be so unusable that it is likely to be disabled; and d) a proposed resolution can introduce side-effects that are unacceptable. Timeliness for determining and implementing a resolution based on the impact of the security-related issue will typically align with market forces and may drive establishment of clear interfaces to related organizational processes (for example, legal, customer service and public relations) to avoid unnecessary delays.</div>
        <h3>Fixing Security-Related Issues</h3>
        <div>a) fixing the issue through one or more of the following:</div>
        <div>This requirement pertains to the methods and practices for addressing and fixing security-related issues within the development lifecycle of industrial automation and control systems.

        <div>A process shall be employed for informing product users about reportable security-related issues (see 1 0.5) in supported products in a timely manner with content that includes but is not limited to the following in formation: a) issue description, vulnerability score as per CVSS or a s im i lar system for ranking vulnerabilities, and affected product version(s); and b) description of the resolution. The strategy for handling third-party component vulnerabilities discovered by the product developer should take in to account the possibility of premature public disclosure by the third-party component supplier.</div>
        <div>This process is required to ensure that product users are in formed of resolved security-related issues that have been designated as reportable. Reportable resolutions are typically those that are related to released products and whose issue severity is deemed high enough to report by the product supplier. Product users need this in formation to make in formed security assessments about their operations, and service providers use this in formation to handle vulnerabilities as part of their event management capability (see IEC 62443-2-4). Having this process means that the product supplier has procedures for determining which security issues are reportable, and reporting resolutions for reportable issues to the users of the product. The disclosure process will typically include provisions for informational alerts in addition to vulnerability notices. For example, in formational alerts can be used to notify product users of compensating mechanisms in response to current cybersecurity activity or to inform product users that the product is not susceptible to a highly publicized vulnerability. See IEC 291 47 [22] for in formation regarding content of notifications.</div>
