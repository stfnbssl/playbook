To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.",

Because the system development life cycle involves multiple organizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective management of the system during the life cycle."

Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications.

Loss of integrity of any aspect of the development environment (e. g., the product design and implementation, code signing in frastructure, and software build environment) can negatively affect fielded versions of the product without the knowledge of the organization or its customers. For example, the ability of an attacker to insert an infection in the binary code of a product could lead to that infection being distributed as part of the released product. Having this process means that the product supplier has mechanisms in place to protect the integrity of design documents, the product implementation (for example, code and user manuals), configuration settings and private keys used for signing software images. For example, application of ISO/IEC 27001 [20] and ISO/IEC 27002 [19] policies and controls can reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to source code or corruption of source code. They can also reduce the likelihood of unauthorized disclosure of product designs and test results that could be used to compromise fielded versions of the product.

Supply chain security applies to components which are included within the product and are provided external to the development team responsible for a given product, but do not meet the definition described in 5.12. The security provided by such third-party components is directly related to their role in the product's secure design and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7). Having this process means that the product supplier is able to identify when one or more of the following characteristics apply to the use of third-party components in the product: a) the degree to which the component aligns with the product’s security context (see Clause 6) and defense in depth strategy (see Clause 7); b) the degree of rigor applied to the component’s implementation (see Clause 8); c) the degree of security verification and validation performed on the component by the product supplier or the component supplier (see Clause 9); d) how to receive and/or monitor notifications about security-related issues from the component supplier (see Clause 10) and patches (see Clause 11); and e) the sufficiency of security documentation for the component (see Clause 12). f) the degree that the software is currently supported by the supplier or open source community. Examples of work items that would satisfy some elements of this requirement include: – identifying known vulnerabilities in specific versions of open source software components and updating the version of the open source components to the version that fixes the vulnerability; – evaluating the compliance of vendors of commercial off the shelf (COTS) components to this document or a similar SDL standard; and – employing compensating mechanisms for known vulnerabilities on COTS or open source components (such as static code analysis). It is recommended that there be an inventory of components from third party suppliers in order to facilitate defect management (see Clause 6).

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance."

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored.

New security threats are constantly being identified and exploited by attackers so it is important product suppliers help compensate for this by continuously improving their SDL. Continuous improvement is a well-established and proven method of improving product quality. Since product security issues are a type of quality issue, conti nuous improvement methodologies are applicable to an SDL. See Annex A for potential metrics related to SDL effectiveness and improvement. Having this process means that the supplier has a procedure in place to review the process and security defects that escape to the field on a periodic basis and that this procedure includes making improvements to the process as a result of these reviews. Some examples of activities that would help improve a product supplier’s SDL are included in Table 2. Ultimately it is up to suppliers to implement their own means of continuously improving their SDL. Table 2 – Example SDL continuous improvement activities Activity SDL / security benefits Use a known security vulnerability database to help improve the threat model. For example, if the threat model indicates that the product uses the TLS protocol for transport security, review known vulnerabilities in TLS implementations and ensure these are mitigated in the design. Improves the threat model by keeping it current with actual security issues observed in the field. Attend external security / SDL conferences or participate in industry SDL groups such as OWASP Helps a product supplier stay current with emerging threats and SDL best practices. Conduct internal SDL conferences or sessions for sharing of SDL expertise and best practices within the product supplier’s organization. Improve the overall SDL expertise of the product supplier’ s employees and hel p them stay current with emerg ing security threats and SDL best practices. Perform SDL root cause analysis for security vulnerabilities found externally in a supplier’ s product and identify p l us implement correcti ve action. Al l SDL practices shou ld be in scope for this analysis. Root cause analysis and corrective action is a well-established method for improving product quality. Since security issues are quality issues it works well for an SDL too. Combine manual penetration testing with automated tool base testing or use multiple similar security testing tools for SVV-3 vulnerability testing. Improves test coverage relative to using a single automated tool. This becomes especially valuable after the existing automated tool stops finding new vulnerabilities. Create fuzzing tools for any protocols for which tools are not available. Help avoid the scenario where an attacker develops its own fuzzing tool and uses it to find and exploit security vulnerabilities in a product. Train and use dedicated security testing experts for SVV-3 vulnerability testing. Since security vulnerability requires extensive and constantly growing expertise, developing and using dedicated experts will improve security test coverage.",

Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities in systems, system components, and services that result from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)."

For example, it is important to document whether physical security is required. If no physical security is expected to be present, then that may add a number of related requirements such as not allowing push button configuration on the product. Another example is if the product is expected to be protected by a user supplied firewall that connects it to the plant network, the product would typically not require a firewall of its own. Documenting these external security features for the product (its security context) allows developers to design a defense in depth strategy that complements this security context and testers to validate and verify the security of a product in an environment similar to how it shou ld be deployed.

External dependencies are external components or systems that the product depends upon for security. As an example, a product could depend on power for physical security. Or a product could depend on the session management of a web server to be secure. In these examples, failure of the external dependency could lead to a security vulnerability in the product, so mitigations need to be put in place to minimize the chances of such failures. So for the power example, the mitigation could be the installation of an un interruptable power supply (UPS). In the example of a web server, security should be considered when choosing a web server, and if a secure web server cannot be found, then other compensating measures need to be considered. Third-party code is an external dependency that can present significant challenges in determining where the threats can occur. If deeply embedded there might not be access to/from this code that crosses a trust boundary. If there is access to the trust boundary, a deeper inspection of the third-party code can be needed.",

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

            "rationale": "This process is required to ensure that security for access to assets is comprehensively addressed from the perspective of external and internal interfaces of the product through which attacks can be mounted. Having this process means that interfaces of the product are identified and characterized by the interactions that take place over them (for example, data and control flows), the security mechanisms designed to protect them and the assets that can be compromised if not adequately protected. Interfaces include physical and wireless connections to networks (for example, Ethernet) and devices (for example, keyboards, monitors and USB/compact disc [CD]/digital versatile disc [DVD] media). Logical interfaces support data control flows (for example, application messaging) between product components and include mechanisms such as application programming interfaces (for example, structured queryl anguage [SQL]) and communications protocols (for example, the transmission control protocol [TCP]). Protection mechanisms include general hardening capabilities (for example, security policy settings), user access controls (for example, account management), and security event detection and reporting, among others. Viewing interfaces within the setting provided by the product security context allows the secure design to focus on the specific environment in which the product is expected to operate, including both protections offered by the product security context and vulnerabilities resulting from it (for example, where it can be open to attack). For an internal component of the design, the concept of the product security context is extended to include the security context provided by surround ing product components. For example, the product security context of an application program running on a workstation that is part of an industrial control system product includes the network(s) to which the workstation connects and the software environment of the workstation in which the application runs. Identifying threats, users, assets and trust boundaries associated withinterfaces specifies who is expected to use the interfaces, and indicates where threats and unknown subjects potentially can ga in access to the interface and the assets that can be accessed through it. This allows the reduction of the number of interfaces where possible and to provide the appropriate safeguards for the remaining interfaces and the assets that can be accessed through them. Identifying trust boundaries also supports future definition of zones and conduits (see IEC 62443-3-2 [9]), and thus is a primary component in the definition of the security architecture of the product. Sample data assets (resources) include: a) databases and database tables; b) configuration files; c) cryptographic key stores; d) access control lists (ACLs); e) registry keys; f) web pages (static and dynamic); g) audit logs; h) network sockets / network media; i) inter-process communications (IPC), services and remote procedure call (RPC) resources; j) any other files and directories; and k) any other memory resource. Based on analysis of the product security requirements, the product security context and trust boundary considerations, the design can be developed for interfaces that include the definition of user roles, privileges and authorization/access permissions required to use the interfaces as well as specific security capabilities (for example, authentication, encryption and logging) that provide additional safeguards. As part of the design of the defense in depth strategy, the expected use of compensating mechanisms and third-party hardware or software components will aid in the assessment of the adequacy of the defense in depth strategy (see 7.4). Finally, preparing documentation for the use of externally accessible interfaces (for example, by users and third-parties) reduces the potential for accidental misuse.",

                                "The principles of modularity and layering are fundamental across system engineering disciplines. Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains."

The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements.

Dynamic code analysis employs runtime tools to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)."

It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool.

Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities in systems, system components, and services that result from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications.

The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection requirements for documentation."

Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary actions.

Dynamic code analysis employs runtime tools to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed.

Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)."

This process is required to ensure that efforts have been taken to discover security-related issues in the product or product documentation that could allow the product to be exploited. Having this process means that the product supplier attempts to breach the security of the product through penetration testing. Penetration testing consists of confirm ing that vulnerabilities in any product capability or the defense in depth strategy can be exploited and used to compromise security of the product.

Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)."

Table 3 – Required level of independence of testers from developers Test type | Reference | Level of independence Security requirements testing | SVV-1 – security requirements testing | Independent department Threat mitigation testing | SVV-2 – Threat mitigation testing | Independent department Abuse case testing | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Static code analysis | SI-1 – Security implementation review | None Attack surface analysis | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Known vulnerability scanning | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | Independent person Software composition analysis | SVV-3 – vulnerability testing | None Penetration testing | SVV-4 – Penetration testing | Independent department or organization The levels of independence are defined as follows: None – no independence required. Developer can perform the testing. Independent person – the person who performs the testing cannot be one of the developers of the product. Independent department – the person who performs the testing cannot report to the same fi rst line manager as any developers of the product. Al ternatively, they could be a member of a qua l ity assurance (QA) department. Independent organization – the person who performs the testing cannot be part of the same organization as any developers of the product. An organization can be a separate l egal en ti ty, a d i vi s ion of a company or a departmen t of a company that reports to a different executive such as a vice president or s im i lar level.",
            "rationale": "An independent tester can often find out more, other and different defects than a tester working within a programming team – or a tester who is by profession a programmer. Such a tester brings a different set of assumptions to testing and to reviews, which often helps in exposing the hidden defects and problems. In addition, an independent tester who reports to senior management can report his results honestly and without any concern for reprisal that might result from pointing out problems in co-workers’ or, worse yet, the manager’s work. Add itional security defects can often be found when a tester’s black-box level knowledge of the product is supplemented with whi te-box level knowledge of a developer acting as an advisor to the tester.",

Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities in systems, system components, and services that result from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

Dynamic code analysis employs runtime tools to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms)."

It may also include personnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see SR-1) for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and system components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations have methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems, system components, and related data. These actions help track, assess, and document any changes to the provenance, including changes in supply chain elements or configuration, and help ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance change records.

            "rationale": "This process is required to ensure that the potential impact of security-related design issues is examined and understood to support decis ions related to how they will be addressed. Having this process means that the product supplier assesses the potential impact and severity of each security-related issue, determines whether the issues exist in other products or versions (for example, by using the same or similar components) and identifies the root causes of the issue. Completing such an assessment provides the basis for determining how to address the issue (see 1 0.5), and which development life-cycle processes, such as redesign activi ti es and threat model updates, may be involved in the resolution. Verifiable security-related issues can vary widely in their security impact and their distribution within the product, so there needs to be a process for characterizing each issue so that an appropriate resolution can be determined. It is recommended that the process identify conditions that would exit the security defect management process such as duplicate, non-security, and third-party security-related issues (see ISO/IEC 301 1 1). The impact assessment should also take into consideration additional factors such as the scope of affected product users, the potential for collateral damage, the availability of exploits and (for control systems) the potential impact to essential functions (see IEC 62443-3-3). The impact assessment may be as simple as a qualitative rating (for example, low, medium and high), a more quantitative method based on likelihood and consequence or a standardized method such as the CVSS. A security-related issue that is associated with a widely used design pattern or implementation method can be symptomatic of a larger problem. In such a situation, the impact assessment associated with the vulnerability should address the combined impact of all instances rather than dealing with each instance in isolation.",

In all cases, the following shall be done as well: a) in form other processes of the issue or related issue(s), including processes for other products/product revisions; and b) in form third parties if problems found in included third-party source code.

Having this process means that the product supplier reviews the potential residual risk of each security-related issue and makes a justifiable decision for how to handle (address) it. Residual risk can be determined using many different methods. An example would be to start with CVSS score, but then add other security controls and countermeasures not accounted for in CVSS such as whether the issue is applicable to the product’s security context. The process for deciding upon and implementing a resolution to a security-related issue needs to address these considerations (see ISO/IEC 301 1 1) because of their potential impact: a) a proposed resolution can violate a premise of the secure design that other aspects of the product rely upon; b) a proposed resolution can be unnecessary because of a m ismatch between the reporting entity’ s security context and the product security context; c) a proposed resolution can only partially reduce the impact of the security-related issue, may take an unacceptably long time to implement because of its complexi ty, or may be so unusable that it is likely to be disabled; and d) a proposed resolution can introduceside-effects that are unacceptable. Timeliness for determining and implementing a resolution based on the impact of the security-related issue will typically align with market forces and may drive establishment of clear interfaces to related organizational processes (for example, legal, customer service and public relations) to avoid unnecessary delays.",

The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that any as shipped configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does not aid in the violation of the security policy and can prevent the system from operating in the default configuration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration by the operational user.",
                                "Restrictive defaults mean that the system will operate as-shipped with adequate self-protection and be able to prevent security breaches before the intended security policy and system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by the as-shipped product is inadequate, stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In situations where the system fails to complete initialization, either it will perform a requested operation using secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover from failure.",
                                "The security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms deny requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the security policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless it is shown to be inconsistent with the policy. In a large system, the conditions that are satisfied to grant a request that is denied by default are often far more compact and complete than those that would need to be checked in order to deny a request that is granted by default."
