Authentication of the identity of these users should be accomplished by using methods such as passwords, tokens, biometrics or, in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. The geographic location of human users can also be used as part of the authentication process. This requirement should be applied to both local and remote access to the control system. In addition to identifying and authenticating all human users at the control system level (for example, at system logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are often employed at the application level. Where human users function as a single group (such as control room operators), user identification and authentication may be role-based or group-based. For some control systems, the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. It is essential that local emergency actions as well as control system essential functions not be hampered by identification or authentication requirements (see Clause 4 for a more complete discussion). Access to these systems may be restricted by appropriate physical security mechanisms (see IEC 62443‑2‑1). An example of such a situation is a critical operations room where strict physical access control and monitoring is in place and where shift plans allocate responsibility to a group of users. These users may then be using the same user identity. In addition, the designated operator workstation clients should be authenticated (see 5.4, SR 1.2 – Software process and device identification and authentication) or the use of this shared account should be limited to the constrained environment of the control room. In order to support IAC policies, as defined according to IEC 62443‑2‑1, the control system verifies the identity of all human users as a first step. In a second step, the permissions assigned to the identified human user are enforced (see 6.3, SR 2.1 – Authorization enforcement).",

Allowing rogue entities to send and receive control system specific data can result in detrimental behavior of the legitimate control system. All entities need to be identified and authenticated for all access to the control system. Authentication of the identity of such entities should be accomplished by using methods such as passwords, tokens or location (physical or logical). This requirement should be applied to both local and remote access to the control system. However, in some scenarios where individual entities are used to connect to different target systems (for example, remote vendor support), it may be technically infeasible for an entity to have multiple identities. In these cases, compensating countermeasures would have to be applied. Identification and authentication mechanisms for all entities are needed to protect against attacks such as man-in-the-middle or message spoofing. In some cases, these mechanisms may involve multiple software processes running on the same physical server, each having their own identity. In other cases, the identity may be bound to the physical device, such as all processes running on a given PLC. Special attention needs to be made when identifying and authenticating portable and mobile devices. These types of devices are a known method of introducing undesired network traffic, malware and/or information exposure to control systems, including otherwise isolated networks. Where entities function as a single group, identification and authentication may be role-based, group-based or entity-based, it is essential that local emergency actions as well as control system essential functions not be hampered by identification or authentication requirements (see Clause 4 for a more complete discussion). For example, in common protection and control schemes, a group of devices jointly execute the protection functions and communicate with multicast messages among the devices in the group. In these cases, group authentication based on shared accounts or shared symmetric keys are commonly used. In order to support identification and authentication control policies as defined according to IEC 62443‑2‑1, the control system verifies the identity of all entities as a first step.

Non-human user accounts (sometimes termed service accounts) that are utilized for software process-to-process communication (for example, control server to historian and PLC to control server) typically require different security policies and procedures from human user accounts.

                    "rationale": "In addition to an identifier (see 5.6, SR 1.4 – Identifier management) an authenticator is required to prove identity. Control system authenticators include, but are not limited to, tokens, symmetric keys, private keys (part of a public/private key pair), biometrics, passwords, physical keys and key cards. Human users should take reasonable measures to safeguard authenticators, including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticators have a lifecycle. When an account is created automatically a new authenticator needs to be created, in order for the account owner to be able to authenticate. For example, in a password-based system, the account has a password associated with it. Definition of the initial authenticator content could be interpreted as the administrator defining the initial password which the account management system sets for all new accounts. Being able to configure these initial values makes it harder for an attacker to guess the password between account creation and first account use (which should involve the setting of a new password by the account owner). Some control systems are installed with unattended installers which create all necessary accounts with default passwords and some embedded devices are shipped with default passwords. Over time, these passwords often become general knowledge and are documented on the Internet. Being able to change the default passwords protects the system against unauthorized users using default passwords to gain access. Passwords can be obtained from storage or from transmission when used in network authentication. The complexity of this can be increased by cryptographic protections such as encryption or hashing or by handshake protocols which do not require transmission of the password at all. Still, passwords might be subject to attacks, for example brute force guessing or breaking the cryptographic protection of passwords in transit or storage. The window of opportunity can be reduced by changing/refreshing the passwords periodically. Similar considerations apply to authentication systems based on cryptographic keys. Enhanced protection can be achieved by using hardware mechanisms such as hardware security modules like trusted platform modules (TPMs). The management of authenticators should be specified in applicable security policies and procedures, for example, constraints to change default authenticators, refresh periods, specification of the protection of authenticators or firecall (see 3.1.24) procedures. Lockout or loss of control due to security measures is not acceptable. If the control system is required to have a high level of availability, measures should be taken to maintain this high level of availability (such as compensating physical countermeasures, duplicate keys and supervisory override). Besides the capabilities for authenticator management specified in this requirement, the strength of the authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the chosen authenticator (for example password complexity or key length in public key authentication) and the policies for validating the authenticator in the authentication process (for example how long a password is valid or which checks are performed in public key certificate validation). For the most common authentication mechanisms password-based and public key authentication 5.9, SR 1.7 – Strength of password-based authentication, 5.10, SR 1.8 – Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates and 5.11, SR 1.9 – Strength of public key authentication provide further requirements.",

Many attacks on such mechanisms focus on guessing the password (for example, dictionary attacks or targeted social engineering) or breaking the cryptographic protection of the stored password representation (for example, using rainbow tables or brute-forcing a hash collision). Increasing the size of the set of valid passwords by increasing the number of allowed characters makes such attacks more complex, but only if the increased set size is actually used (generally users would tend to not include special characters in a password as they are perceived as harder to remember). Limiting the lifetime of a password decreases the window of opportunity for an attacker to breach a given password’s secrecy. In order to prevent users from circumventing this control by once changing their password to a new one and then immediately changing back to their original password, a minimum lifetime for a password is commonly enforced as well. A notification to change the password prior the expiration allows the user to change the password at a convenient time according to process operations conditions. This protection can be further enhanced by limiting the reuse of passwords (preventing small sets of alternating passwords), which further decreases the usefulness of a once-breached password. Extended protection beyond password based mechanisms can be achieved using multifactor authentication (see 5.3, SR 1.1 – Human user identification and authentication and 5.4, SR 1.2 – Software process and device identification and authentication).",

When verifying a trust between two entities based on public key authentication, it is essential to trace the public key certificate to a trusted entity. A common implementation error in certificate validation is to only check the validity of a certificate’s signature, but not checking the trust in the signer. In a PKI setting, a signer is trusted if they are a trusted CA or have a certificate issued by a trusted CA, thus all verifiers need to trace certificates presented to them back to a trusted CA. If such a chain of trusted CAs cannot be established, the presented certificate should not be trusted. If self-signed certificates are used instead of a PKI, the certificate subject itself signed its certificate, thus there never is a trusted third-party or CA. This should be compensated by deploying the self-signed public key certificates to all peers that need to validate them via an otherwise secured mechanism (for example, configuration of all peers in a trusted environment). Trusted certificates need to be distributed to peers through secure channels. During the validation process, a self-signed certificate should only be trusted if it is already present in the list of trusted certificates of the validating peer. The set of trusted certificates should be configured to the minimum necessary set. In both cases, validation needs to also consider the possibility that a certificate is revoked. In a PKI setting this is typically done by maintaining certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or running an online certificate status protocol (OCSP) server. When revocation checking is not available due to control system constraints, mechanisms such as a short certificate lifetime can compensate for the lack of timely revocation information. Note that short lifetime certificates can sometimes create significant operational issues in a control system environment.",

                    "rationale": "Many common network attacks are based on the manipulation of data in transmission, for example manipulation of network packets. Switched or routed networks provide a greater opportunity for attackers to manipulate packets as undetected access to these networks is generally easier and the switching and routing mechanisms themselves can also be manipulated in order to get more access to transmitted information. Manipulation in the context of a control system could include the change of measurement values communicated from a sensor to a receiver or the alteration of command parameters sent from a control application to an actuator. Depending on the context (for example transmission within a local network segment versus transmission via untrusted networks) and the network type used in the transmission (for example transmission control protocol (TCP) / internet protocol (IP) versus local serial links), feasible and appropriate mechanisms will vary. On a small network with direct links (point-to-point), physical access protection to all nodes may be sufficient on lower SLs if the endpoints’ integrity is protected as well (see 7.6, SR 3.4 – Software and information integrity), while on a network distributed in areas with regular physical presence of staff or on a wide area network physical access is likely not enforceable. If a commercial service is used to provide communication services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service (for example a leased line versus a T1 link), it may be more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for communication integrity (for example because of legal restrictions). When it is infeasible or impractical to meet the necessary security requirements it may be appropriate to implement either appropriate compensating countermeasures or explicitly accept the additional risk. Industrial equipment is often subject to environmental conditions that can lead to integrity issues and/or false positive incidents. Many times the environment contains particulates, liquids, vibration, gases, radiation, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can cause conditions that affect the integrity of the communication wiring and signals. The network infrastructure should be designed to minimize these physical/environmental effects on communication integrity. For example, when particulate, liquids, and/or gases are an issue, it may be necessary to use a sealed registered jack 45 (RJ-45) or M12 connector instead of a commercial-grade RJ-45 connector on the wire. The cable itself may need to use a different jacket instead to handle the particulate, liquid, and/or gas as well. In cases where vibration is an issue, M12 connectors may be necessary to prevent the spring pins on an RJ-45 connector from disconnecting during use. In cases where radiation and/or EMI are an issue, it may be necessary to use shielded twisted pair or fiber cables to prevent any effect on the communication signals. It may also be necessary to perform a wireless spectrum analysis in these areas if wireless networking is planned to verify that it is a viable solution.",

It is crucial that the technique chosen considers the potential ramifications on control system performance and the capability to recover from system failure or attack. The decision whether the confidentiality of a given piece of information should be protected or not depends on the context and cannot be made at product design. However, the fact that an organization limits access to information by configuring explicit read authorizations in the control system is an indicator that this information is considered confidential by the organization. Thus, all information for which the control system supports the capability to assign explicit read authorizations should be considered potentially confidential and thus the control system should also provide the capability to protect it. Different organizations and industries may require different levels of encryption strength for different categories of information, based on the sensitivity of the information as well as industry standards and regulatory requirements (see 8.5, SR 4.3 – Use of cryptography). In some situations network configuration information stored and processed in switches and routers may be considered as confidential. Communications involving exposed information transfer may be vulnerable to eavesdropping or tampering. If the control system is depending upon an external communications service provider, it may be more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security requirements for communication confidentiality. In such cases, it may be appropriate to implement compensating countermeasures or explicitly accept the additional risk. Entities should also be cognizant of information confidentiality when portable and mobile devices are utilized (for example, engineering laptops and USB sticks). As required by 5.7, SR 1.5 – Authenticator management, authentication information, such as passwords, should be considered confidential, and thus never be sent in the clear.",

                    "rationale": "Network segmentation is used by organizations for a variety of purposes, including cyber security. The main reasons for segmenting networks are to reduce the exposure, or ingress, of network traffic into a control system and reduce the spread, or egress, of network traffic from a control system. This improves overall system response and reliability as well as provides a measure of cyber security protection. It also allows different network segments within the control system, including critical control systems and safety-related systems, to be segmented from other systems for an additional level of protection. Access from the control system to the World Wide Web should be clearly justified based on control system operational requirements. Network segmentation and the level of protection it provides will vary greatly depending on the overall network architecture used by an asset owner in their facility and even system integrators within their control systems. Logically segmenting networks based on their functionality provides some measure of protection, but may still lead to single-points-of-failure if a network device is compromised. Physically segmenting networks provides another level of protection by removing that single-point-of-failure case, but will lead to a more complex and costly network design. These trade-offs will need to be evaluated during the network design process (see IEC 62443‑2‑1). In response to an incident, it may be necessary to break the connections between different network segments. In that event, the services necessary to support essential operations should be maintained in such a way that the devices can continue to operate properly and/or shutdown in an orderly manner. This may require that some servers may need to be duplicated on the control system network to support normal network features, for example dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), domain name service (DNS) or local CAs. It may also mean that some critical control systems and safety-related systems be designed from the beginning to be completely isolated from other networks.",

These systems are usually utilized for private purposes which are not related to control system operations, and therefore the risks imposed by these systems normally outweigh any perceived benefit. These types of general purpose communications systems are commonly used attack vectors to introduce malware to the control system, pass information for which read authorization exists to locations external to the control system, and introduce excessive network loading that can be used to create security problems or launch attacks on the control system. Application of a broad range of other system requirements covering, for example, usage restrictions and limiting data flow as described elsewhere in this standard to general purpose person-to-person communication systems can provide adequate compensating countermeasures to meet this requirement. The control system may provide the capability to utilize these types of two-way communication systems, but only between servers and/or workstations within the control system.

The control system may also restrict email or other messaging solutions that provide internal computer-to-external computer communications using outbound messages. These internal-to-external communications may be limited to the purpose of sending system alerts or other computer generated information messages to users or systems external to the control system. To prevent the passing of information for which explicit read authorization is supported, pre-configured messages (perhaps with the ability to include some limited text) should be used to transmit the alerts or status information.
